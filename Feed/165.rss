<p>Summary : Is it a school day? Is it pizza day? Is it a snow day? Jasmine wants it all!Neat! Neat! Snowy feet! Snowy feet can?t be beat! Wintertime is fun!There?s a big blizzard blowing in, but that?s not going to stop Jasmine from going to school ? it?s just a little snow, and it?s pizza day, after all! But as soon as she sets out the snow starts to come down faster and faster until she finds herself frozen stiff, with just her hat poking out of a snowdrift.Rescue comes in the form of the school custodian, who stomps out on snowshoes, yanks her out, pulls her inside and figures out how to get her thawed. But on the way to her class they notice that the school is empty ? the principal has declared a snow day! Which is always great news . . . but how is Jasmine going to get her pizza?</p>

<p>Summary : The Inheritance Games ended with a bombshell, and now heiress Avery Grambs has to pick up the pieces and find the man who might hold the answers to all of her questions &#8211; including why Tobias Hawthorne left his entire fortune to Avery, a virtual stranger, rather than to his own daughters or grandsons.As the mystery grows and the plot thickens, Grayson and Jameson, the enigmatic and magnetic Hawthorne grandsons, continue to pull Avery in different directions. And there are threats lurking around every corner, as adversaries emerge who will stop at nothing to see Avery out of the picture &#8211; by any means necessary. With nonstop action, aspirational jet-setting, family intrigue, swoonworthy romance, and billions of dollars hanging in the balance, The Hawthorne Legacy will thrill Jennifer Lynn Barnes fans and new readers alike.</p>

<p>Summary : MURDER AND DECEPTION IN THE OLD BAILEY. Meet Adam Green. Misfit. Purveyor of justice. Barrister-in-training. When hero policeman Grant Cliveden dies from a poisoning in the Old Bailey, it threatens to shake the country to its core. The evidence points to one man.

<p>Summary : When two young rival journalists find love through a magical connection, they must face the depths of hell, in a war among gods, to seal their fate forever.After centuries of sleep, the gods are warring again. But eighteen-year-old Iris Winnow just wants to hold her family together. Her mother is suffering from addiction and her brother is missing from the front lines. Her best bet is to win the columnist promotion at the Oath Gazette.To combat her worries, Iris writes letters to her brother and slips them beneath her wardrobe door, where they vanish?into the hands of Roman Kitt, her cold and handsome rival at the paper. When he anonymously writes Iris back, the two of them forge a connection that will follow Iris all the way to the front lines of battle: for her brother, the fate of mankind, and love.Shadow and Bone meets Lore in this epic enemies-to-lovers fantasy novel filled with hope and heartbreak, and the unparalleled power of love.</p>

<p>Summary : The Crimes Are UnthinkableA serial killer is turning the Big Easy into his personal playground. The victims are killed in pairs&#8211;no connection, no apparent motive, no real clues. It&#8217;s a very sick game, and it&#8217;s only just begun. <br />
  The Fear Is Real <br />
Abby Chastain left New Orleans long ago and for good reason. Now she&#8217;s back where she feels watched, as if the devil himself is scraping a fingernail along her spine. It doesn&#8217;t help that Detective Reuben Montoya is convinced she&#8217;s somehow the key to unlocking these horrible crimes&#8211;a mystery that has something to do with Our Lady of Virtues Mental Hospital, a decaying old asylum where unspeakable crimes were once committed, and a human predator may still wait. <br />
  The Truth Is Deadly <br />
As more bodies are found in gruesome, staged scenarios, Montoya and Abby are in a desperate race to stop a killer whose terrifying crimes are bringing them ever nearer to a shocking revelation. For the past is never completely gone. Its sins must be avenged. And </p>

<p>Summary : What if a meteor shower left most of the world blind?and humanity at the mercy of mysterious and carnivorous plants?Bill Masen undergoes eye surgery and misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever. But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the strange plants known as Triffids. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind. Wyndham chillingly anticipates bio-warfare and mass destruction, fifty years before their realization, in this prescient account of Cold War paranoia.</p>

<p>Summary : What if a meteor shower left most of the world blind?and humanity at the mercy of mysterious and carnivorous plants?Bill Masen undergoes eye surgery and misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever. But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the strange plants known as Triffids. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind. Wyndham chillingly anticipates bio-warfare and mass destruction, fifty years before their realization, in this prescient account of Cold War paranoia.</p>

<p>Summary : On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its first publication, here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as ?the most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust? (Wall Street Journal) and ?the first masterpiece in comic book history? (The New Yorker).The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler?s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father?s story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in ?drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust? (The New York Times).Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek?s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author?s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father.

<p>Summary : Introducing a sweet and silly buffalo who tries to bluff and fluff his way into being bigger than he really is. This laugh-out-loud story by an Emmy-nominated comedy writer shows it?s okay to be yourself.I?m the Buffalo FluffaloI heave and I huffaloLeave me alone becauseI?ve had enuffalo.Buffalo Fluffalo arrives on the scene puffed up with self-importance. Stomping around and raising billows of dust, Buffalo Fluffalo proclaims his superiority to the other creatures?the ram, the prairie dog, and the crow?who just want to be his friend. So Buffalo Fluffalo, who has had enuffalo , heads off to grumble to himself. Suddenly, a rain shower pours down from the clouds and?what?s this? All of his fluffalo is a soggy mess! There Fluffalo stands, a drenched pip-squeak without his disguise. The other animals, who could see through Fluffalo?s bravado from the start, circle around to comfort him. As prairie dog says with a smile in his eyes, You?re great how you are, no matter your size .Readers </p>

<p>Summary : In one devastating week, Raynor and her husband Moth lost their house and received a terminal diagnosis that took away their future together. With nowhere to call home, they instead embarked on a journey: to walk the South West Coast Path, a 630-mile sea-swept trail from Somerset to Dorset, via Devon and Cornwall.This ancient, wind-battered landscape lays them bare, stripping away every comfort they have ever known.

<p>Summary : In one devastating week, Raynor and her husband Moth lost their house and received a terminal diagnosis that took away their future together. With nowhere to call home, they instead embarked on a journey: to walk the South West Coast Path, a 630-mile sea-swept trail from Somerset to Dorset, via Devon and Cornwall.This ancient, wind-battered landscape lays them bare, stripping away every comfort they have ever known. With almost no money for food orshelter, carrying the essentials for survival on their backs, they wild camp on beaches and clifftops.

<p>Summary : An electric and unforgettable memoir about a young woman&#8217;s journey?from the ice rink, to addiction and a prison sentence, to the newsroom?and how she emerged with a fierce determination to expose the broken system she experienced.An elite, competitive figure skater growing up, Keri Blakinger poured herself into the sport, even competing at nationals. But when her skating partnership ended abruptly, her world shattered. With all the intensity she saved for the ice, she dove into self-destruction. From her first taste of heroin, the next nine years would be a blur?living on the streets, digging for a vein, selling drugs and sex, eventually plunging off a bridge when it all became too much, all while trying to hold herself together enough to finish her degree at Cornell.Then, on a cold day during Keri&#8217;s senior year, the police stopped her. Caught with a Tupperware container full of heroin, she was arrested and ushered into a holding cell, a county jail, and finally into state prison. </p>

<p>Summary : An exquisitely moving story about grief, love, and family, from the global phenomenon Sally Rooney. Aside from the fact that they are brothers, Peter and Ivan Koubek seem to have little in common.Peter is a Dublin lawyer in his thirties?successful, competent, and apparently unassailable. But in the wake of their father?s death, he?s medicating himself to sleep and struggling to manage his relationships with two very different women?his enduring first love, Sylvia, and Naomi, a college student for whom life is one long joke.Ivan is a twenty-two-year-old competitive chess player. He has always seen himself as socially awkward, a loner, the antithesis of his glib elder brother. Now, in the early weeks of his bereavement, Ivan meets Margaret, an older woman emerging from her own turbulent past, and their lives become rapidly and intensely intertwined.For two grieving brothers and the people they love, this is a new interlude?a period of desire, despair, and possibility; a chance to find </p>

<p>Summary : The third volume that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien?s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.This, the third volume of The History of Middle-earth, gives us a privileged insight into the creation of the mythology of Middle-earth, through the alliterative verse tales of two of the most crucial stories in Tolkien?s world?those of Turien and Luthien. The first of the poems is the unpublished Lay of The Children of Hurin, narrating on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. The second is the moving Lay of Leithian, the chief source of the tale of Beren and Luthien in The Silmarillion, telling of the Quest of the Silmaril and the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress.Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days, which was much developed during the years of the composition of the two Lays. Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, </p>

Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, </p>

<p>Summary : Trinta e cinco anos depois de Feliz ano velho, a luta de uma fam?lia pela verdadeEunice Paiva ? uma mulher de muitas vidas. Casada com o deputado Rubens Paiva, esteve ao seu lado quando foi cassado e exilado, em 1964. M?e de cinco filhos, passou a cri?-los sozinha quando, em 1971, o marido foi preso por agentes da ditadura, a seguir torturado e morto. Em meio ? dor, ela se reinventou. Voltou a estudar, tornou-se advogada, defensora dos direitos ind?genas. Nunca chorou na frente das c?meras. Ao falar de Eunice, e de sua ?ltima luta, desta vez contra o Alzheimer, Marcelo Rubens Paiva fala tamb?m da mem?ria, da inf?ncia e do filho. E mergulha num momento negro da hist?ria recente brasileira para contar ? e tentar entender ? o que de fato ocorreu com Rubens Paiva, seu pai, naquele janeiro de 1971.</p>

Ao falar de Eunice, e de sua ?ltima luta, desta vez contra o Alzheimer, Marcelo Rubens Paiva fala tamb?m da mem?ria, da inf?ncia e do filho. E mergulha num momento negro da hist?ria recente brasileira para contar ? e tentar entender ? o que de fato ocorreu com Rubens Paiva, seu pai, naquele janeiro de 1971.</p>

<p>Summary : As a young boy growing up in the outskirts of Dublin, Gabriel Byrne sought refuge in a world of imagination among the fields and hills near his home, at the edge of a rapidly encroaching city. Born to working class parents and the eldest of six children, he harbored a childhood desire to become a priest. When he was eleven years old, Byrne found himself crossing the Irish Sea to join a seminary in England. Four years later, Byrne had been expelled and he quickly returned to his native city. There he took odd jobs as a messenger boy and a factory laborer to get by. In his spare time, he visited the cinema where he could be alone and yet part of a crowd. It was here that he could begin to imagine a life beyond the grey world of 60s Ireland.He reveled in the theatre and poetry of Dublin&#8217;s streets, populated by characters as eccentric and remarkable as any in fiction, those who spin a yarn with acuity and wit. It was a friend who suggested Byrne join an amateur drama group, a decision </p>

<p>Summary : To get a great answer, you need to ask the perfect question. Warren Berger revives the lost art of questioning.In this groundbreaking book, journalist and innovation expert Warren Berger shows that one of the most powerful forces for igniting change in business and in our daily lives is a simple, under-appreciated tool?one that has been available to us since childhood. Questioning?deeply, imaginatively, &#8220;beautifully&#8221;?can help us identify and solve problems, come up with game-changing ideas, and pursue fresh opportunities. So why are we often reluctant to ask &#8220;Why?&#8221;Berger&#8217;s surprising findings reveal that even though children start out asking hundreds of questions a day, questioning &#8220;falls off a cliff&#8221; as kids enter school. In an education and business culture devised to reward rote answers over challenging inquiry, questioning isn&#8217;t encouraged?and, in fact, is sometimes barely tolerated.And yet, as Berger shows, the most creative, successful people tend to be expert questioners. </p>

<p>Summary : To get a great answer, you need to ask the perfect question. Warren Berger revives the lost art of questioning.In this groundbreaking book, journalist and innovation expert Warren Berger shows that one of the most powerful forces for igniting change in business and in our daily lives is a simple, under-appreciated tool?one that has been available to us since childhood. Questioning?deeply, imaginatively, &#8220;beautifully&#8221;?can help us identify and solve problems, come up with game-changing ideas, and pursue fresh opportunities. So why are we often reluctant to ask &#8220;Why?&#8221;Berger&#8217;s surprising findings reveal that even though children start out asking hundreds of questions a day, questioning &#8220;falls off a cliff&#8221; as kids enter school. In an education and business culture devised to reward rote answers over challenging inquiry, questioning isn&#8217;t encouraged?and, in fact, is sometimes barely tolerated.And yet, as Berger shows, the most creative, successful people tend to be expert questioners. </p>

<p>Summary : #1 New York Times BestsellerGuthrie persuasively renders the evolution of a hard-won religious belief that makes room for imperfection and &#8220;does not require us to ignore&#8230; the sorrows we experience or the unjustness we see but to believe past it.&#8221; This openhearted offering inspires. &#8211; Publishers WeeklyMostly what God does is love you.If we could believe this, really believe this, how different would we be? How different would our lives be? How different would our world be?If you ever struggle with your connection to God (or whether you even feel connected to a faith at all!), you&#8217;re not alone. Especially in our modern world, with its relentless, never-ending news cycle, we can all grapple with such questions. Do we do that alone, with despair and resignation? Or do we make sense of it with God, and with hope? In these uncertain times, could believing in the power of divine love make the most sense?In this collection of essays, Savannah Guthrie shares why she believes it does. </p>

<p>Summary : Escrito em 1938, ap?s uma das maiores crises econ?micas, e precedendo a Segunda Guerra Mundial, este livro n?o somente ? uma fonte de inspira??o e coragem, mas deve ser considerado um manual para todas aquelas pessoas que desejam ser mais espertas que seus medos, problemas e limita??es, pois, como o pr?prio Hill fala: em toda adversidade existe uma semente de benef?cio equivalente. Dessa forma, se voc? deseja ter mais for?a, coragem e f? em si mesmo, para vencer todas as adversidades que surgirem em seu caminho, este livro ser? um presente daquele que voc? deve amar sempre e muito: voc? mesmo. Quando amamos a n?s mesmos e vivemos em paz e harmonia com nossa pr?pria consci?ncia, a? sim encontramos aquele que nos deu o presente da Vida. Sabendo mais sobre o Diabo e suas armadilhas mentais, acabamos nos aproximando mais de Deus.</p>

<p>Summary : Every serial killer needs a friend. Every game must have a winner. When a chance encounter sparks an unlikely bond between rival murderers Sloane and Rowan, the two find something elusive?the friendship of a like-minded, pitch-black soul. From small town West Virginia to upscale California, from downtown Boston to rural Texas, the two hunters collide in an annual game of blood and suffering, one that pits them against the most dangerous monsters in the country. But as their friendship develops into something more, the restless ghosts left in their wake are only a few steps behind, ready to claim more than just their newfound love. Can Rowan and Sloane dig themselves out of a game of graves? Or have they finally met their match? Butcher &amp; Blackbird is the first book in the Ruinous Love Dark Romance trilogy of interconnected stand-alone dark romantic comedies. This dual POV novel ends on a HEA. ***Butcher &amp; Blackbird is a DARK ROMANCE intended for an adult audience &#8211; please see </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  A luminous, generation-defining memoir of foster care and homelessness, Harvard and Big Tech, examining society&#8217;s fixation on resilience&#8211;and its cost <br />
As a homeless teenager writing college essays in her &#8217;92 Toyota Corolla, Emi Nietfeld was convinced that an elite school was the only path away from her dysfunctional childhood. But upward mobility required crafting the perfect resilience narrative, proving that she was an &#8220;overcomer,&#8221; made stronger by all that she had endured.The truth was far murkier. Emi&#8217;s mom was a charming hoarder who had her put on antipsychotics, but believed in her daughter&#8217;s brilliance&#8211;unlike the Minnesotan foster family who banned her &#8220;pornographic&#8221; art history flash cards (of Michelangelo&#8217;s David). Emi&#8217;s other parent&#8217;s departure from her life was tied up in a gender transition that few in the mid-2000s understood. Her own past was filled with facts that she needed to hide: mental health struggles, Adderall addiction, and the unbecoming desperation of a </p>

<p>Summary : Alone in the world, Asher Todd travels to the remote estate of Morwood Grange to become governess to three small children. Her sole possessions comprise a sea chest and a large carpet bag she hangs onto for dear life. She finds a fine old home, its inhabitants proud of their lineage and impeccable reputation, and a small village nearby. It seems an untroubled existence, yet there are portraits missing from the walls, locked rooms, and names excised from the family tree inscribed in the bible. In short order, the children adore her, she becomes indispensible to their father Luther in his laboratory, and her potions are able to restore the sight of granddame Leonora. Soon Asher fits in as if she?s always been there, but there are creatures that stalk the woods at night, spectres haunt the halls, and Asher is not as much a stranger to the Morwoods as it might at first appear.</p>

<p>Summary : Questa ? la storia di un ragazzo che sentiva di non trovarsi nel posto giusto. E cos? ? andato a cercarsene un altro. In famiglia c?erano pochi soldi: quando si andava in pizzeria si sceglieva il piatto che costava meno, non quello che piaceva davvero. Il suo destino sembrava gi? segnato. Non aveva un talento particolare a cui affidarsi n? un grande sogno da inseguire, e ogni volta che cercava di esprimere un desiderio trovava qualcuno che gli diceva che non era per lui. Cos? si era convinto che certi pensieri non se li poteva permettere. Un giorno questo ragazzo scopre i libri in una maniera tutta diversa da come li aveva conosciuti a scuola. E ne rimane folgorato. Le pagine di Hermann Hesse, Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez, Jack London, Joseph Conrad lo spingono ad alzare lo sguardo sopra tutte le seccature e dirsi: ci deve essere uno spazio anche per me da qualche parte. D?un tratto la sua vita non gli calza pi?, come una scarpa di un numero pi? piccolo. La lettura gli ha mostrato una via </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;I don&#8217;t choose him. Not anymore. I&#8217;m choosing me.&#8217;I was told that being confined was to keep the bad out . . . Until I realized it was about keeping me in.Midas made me forbidden and weak. Little did he know that I would find my wings and voice &#8211; which sings now.After living amongst the terrifying army of Fourth Kingdom, I find myself, once again, in strange lands and a kingdom surrounded by liars.But something has ignited within me. Something dark. Something angry.Then comes King Ravinger.And the last thing I wanted was my heart to be torn.Can I really fall in love when the cities around me threaten to crumble and my fate hangs in the balance?One thing is for sure, I won&#8217;t be caught in a cage again.No, this time, it&#8217;ll be me setting the trap.</p>

<p>Summary : A historical thriller by the Pulitzer and National Book Award-winning author that tells the riveting story of the Klan&#8217;s rise to power in the 1920s, the cunning con man who drove that rise, and the woman who stopped them. The Roaring Twenties&#8211;the Jazz Age&#8211;has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he?d become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows ? their message endorsed </p>

<p>Summary : Since it was first published in English, in 1946, Albert Camus&#8217;s first novel, THE STRANGER (L&#8217;etranger), has had a profound impact on millions of American readers. Through this story of an ordinary man who unwittingly gets drawn into a senseless murder on a sun-drenched Algerian beach, Camus explored what he termed &#8220;the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.&#8221;Now, in an illuminating new American translation, extraordinary for its exactitude and clarity, the original intent of THE STRANGER is made more immediate. This haunting novel has been given a new life for generations to come.</p>

<p>Summary : The incredible rags-to-riches story of acclaimed actor Brian Cox, Succession?s Logan Roy, from a troubled, working-class upbringing in Scotland to a prolific career across theatre, film and television.From Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter to media magnate Logan Roy in HBO&#8217;s Succession, Brian Cox has made his name as an actor of unparalleled distinction and versatility. We are familiar with him on screen, but few know of his extraordinary life story. Growing up in Dundee, Scotland, Cox lost his father when he was just eight years old and was brought up by his three elder sisters in the aftermath of his mother&#8217;s nervous breakdowns and ultimate hospitalization. After joining the Dundee Repertory Theatre at the age of fifteen, you could say the rest is history ? but that is to overlook the enormous effort that has gone into the making of the legend we know today.Rich in emotion and meaning, with plenty of laughs along the way, this seminal autobiography captures both Cox&#8217;s distinctive voice </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.&#8221; So begins Political Theology, the book that, marked Carl Schmitt as one of the most significant political and legal theoreticians of the 20th century. Writing amid the intense political and intellectual ferment of the early Weimar Republic, Schmitt argued that the essence of sovereignty ties in the absolute authority to decide when the normal conditions presupposed by the legal authority exist. Because the norms of a legal system cannot govern a state of emergency, they cannot determine when such an exceptional state holds, or what should be done to resolve it. Thus every legal order ultimately rests not upon norms, but rather on the decisions of the sovereign. Schmitt underpins this analysis of sovereignty with a &#8220;political theology&#8221; that claims that all the important concepts of modern political thought are secularized theological concepts; he concludes with an attack on liberalism and its attempt to depoliticize political thought, by </p>

<p>Summary : Calling all unicorn lovers! Get ready for a unicorn graphic novel series unlike any other, that School Library Journal calls a &#8220;girl-powered story of bad unicorns.&#8221; Plenty of attitude, humor, and heart for anyone who loves?or hates?unicorns!Pacey&#8217;s little sister, Mina, has always said her stuffed unicorn, Slasher, is real?but seriously? He&#8217;s a stuffed toy! Then again, he does seem to be leading Mina outside her room and to . . . some kind of weird magical unicorn land? Pacey may not believe in unicorns, but she&#8217;s not about to let her little sister be kidnapped, so she does the only thing she follows them to unicorn land (that she totally does NOT believe in).And for the record, it&#8217;s NOTHING like the stories. First off, what&#8217;s up with Slasher&#8217;s attitude? It&#8217;s not Pacey&#8217;s fault he&#8217;s trapped in a ridiculous stuffed body. And that Alpha Unicorn guy? NOT. Nice. Pacey will just be grabbing Mina and taking her home, thankyouverymuch . . . that is, if she can work with the grumpiest unicorn </p>

<p>Summary : In this greatly expanded edition of his international bestseller, Andreas Moritz reveals the most common but rarely recognized cause of illness &#8211; gallstones congesting the bile ducts in the liver. Besides leading to gallbladder diseases and gallstone attacks in at least 20 million Americans each year, in many cases, liver bile duct congestion sets the stage for even more serious, seemingly unrelated, conditions, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Most adults living in the industrialized world, and especially those suffering a chronic illness, such as irritable bowel syndrome, heart disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, or diabetes, have in fact hundreds if not thousands of gallstones (mainly clumps of hardened bile that escape detection for they are invisible to x-rays, ultrasound, and CT scans) blocking the bile ducts of their liver. This book provides a thorough understanding of the liver and its complex functions, what causes gallstones in the liver </p>

<p>Summary : In 1998, West Point Made David Lipsky an unprecedented offer: stay at the Academy as long as you like, go wherever you wish, talk to whomever you want, to discover why some of America&#8217;s most promising young people sacrifice so much to become cadets. Lipsky followed one cadet class into mess halls, barracks, classrooms, bars, and training exercises, from arrival through graduation. By telling their stories, he also examines the Academy as a reflection of our society: Are its principles of equality, patriotism, and honor quaint anachronisms, or is it still, as Theodore Roosevelt called it, the most &#8220;absolutely American&#8221; institution?</p>

<p>Summary : A deep exploration of the neuroscience behind manifestation, with a six-part plan for realizing your dreamsFor decades the practice of manifestation has been widely dismissed as self-involved, materialistic pseudoscience. But as neuroscientist and recognized compassion leader Dr. James Doty reveals, manifestation introduces us to different possibilities, and it lays the groundwork for a kinder, better world.Doty grounds us in the practices that change our brain attention, meditation, visualization, and compassion. This mind magic allows us to move through the world in ways that help us see clearly?reclaiming our agency, realizing our dreams, and reaching out to help others along the path.Where previous works about manifestation have focused narrowly on outward success and individual benefit, Mind Magic delivers an openhearted call to make manifestation part of a deeper contribution to healing the problems we face today.</p>

<p>Summary : A deep exploration of the neuroscience behind manifestation, with a six-part plan for realizing your dreamsFor decades the practice of manifestation has been widely dismissed as self-involved, materialistic pseudoscience. But as neuroscientist and recognized compassion leader Dr. James Doty reveals, manifestation introduces us to different possibilities, and it lays the groundwork for a kinder, better world.Doty grounds us in the practices that change our brain attention, meditation, visualization, and compassion. This mind magic allows us to move through the world in ways that help us see clearly?reclaiming our agency, realizing our dreams, and reaching out to help others along the path.Where previous works about manifestation have focused narrowly on outward success and individual benefit, Mind Magic delivers an openhearted call to make manifestation part of a deeper contribution to healing the problems we face today.</p>

<p>Summary : The riveting, unforgettable story of a girl whose indomitable spirit is tested by homelessness, poverty, and racism in an unequal America?from Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andrea Elliott of The New York TimesInvisible Child follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani Coates, a child with an imagination as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn homeless shelter. Born at the turn of a new century, Dasani is named for the bottled water that comes to symbolize Brooklyn?s gentrification and the shared aspirations of a divided city. As Dasani grows up, moving with her tight-knit family from shelter to shelter, this story goes back to trace the passage of Dasani?s ancestors from slavery to the Great Migration north. By the time Dasani comes of age, New York City?s homeless crisis is exploding as the chasm deepens between rich and poor. In the shadows of this new Gilded Age, Dasani must lead her seven siblings through a thicket of problems: hunger, parental drug addiction, </p>

<p>Summary : For readers of The Wolf Den and Kaikeyi comes the thrilling tale of the forgotten daughter of a legendary Egyptian pharaoh and the path she must take to escape her own dangerous fate. There are many paths to power. They all come with a price. Neferura, princess and high priestess of Kemet, knows her duty is to her people. When your mother is the great Pharaoh, it is hard to forget. But Neferura&#8217;s unique position at court comes with high stakes for her country, especially when she&#8217;s forced to serve her vile half-brother, a man determined to stop Neferura&#8217;s potential rise. Peace, it seems, never lasts for women who wield power in the open. Especially when they cross a vengeful man. When Neferura overhears Thutmose&#8217;s plot to end her mother&#8217;s rule, she knows he must be stopped, no matter the cost. The discovery of a mysterious tattooed wisewoman and her shadowy network of spies offers an uneasy alliance.

These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.Gladwell uncovers the personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends.

<p>Summary : Maus (&#8220;rato&#8221;, em alem?o) ? a hist?ria de Vladek Spiegelman, judeu-polon?s que sobreviveu ao campo de concentra??o de Auschwitz, narrada por ele pr?prio ao filho Art. O livro ? considerado um cl?ssico contempor?neo das hist?rias em quadrinhos. Foi publicado em duas partes, a primeira em 1986 e a segunda em 1991. No ano seguinte, Maus ganhou o prestigioso Pr?mio Pulitzer de literatura. A obra ? um sucesso estrondoso de p?blico e de cr?tica. Desde que foi lan?ada, tem sido objeto de estudos e an?lises de especialistas de diversas ?reas -hist?ria, literatura, artes e psicologia. Em nova tradu??o, o livro ? agora relan?ado com as duas partes reunidas num s? volume. Nas tiras, os judeus s?o desenhados como ratos e os nazistas ganham fei??es de gatos; poloneses n?o-judeus s?o porcos e americanos, cachorros. Esse recurso, aliado ? aus?ncia de cor dos quadrinhos, reflete o esp?rito do livro: trata-se de um relato incisivo e perturbador, que evidencia a brutalidade da cat?strofe do Holocausto. </p>

<p>Summary : Maus (&#8220;rato&#8221;, em alem?o) ? a hist?ria de Vladek Spiegelman, judeu-polon?s que sobreviveu ao campo de concentra??o de Auschwitz, narrada por ele pr?prio ao filho Art. O livro ? considerado um cl?ssico contempor?neo das hist?rias em quadrinhos. Foi publicado em duas partes, a primeira em 1986 e a segunda em 1991. No ano seguinte, Maus ganhou o prestigioso Pr?mio Pulitzer de literatura. A obra ? um sucesso estrondoso de p?blico e de cr?tica. Desde que foi lan?ada, tem sido objeto de estudos e an?lises de especialistas de diversas ?reas -hist?ria, literatura, artes e psicologia. Em nova tradu??o, o livro ? agora relan?ado com as duas partes reunidas num s? volume.

<p>Summary : I sorg over sin mors d?d begraver den unge videnskabsmand Victor Frankenstein sig i et vanvittigt eksperiment og stykker et v?sen sammen af kropsdele fra lig. Ved hj?lp af lyn i natten gnistrer han liv i skabningen, men da han ser den ?bne sine d?de ?jne, flygter han i r?dsel, og det forladte v?sen er overladt til sig selv, mens det vandrer rundt i verden i en desperat s?gen efter venskab og forst?else. Overalt m?der det afsky og frygt, og verdens afvisninger og dets egen ensomhed ender med at g?re dets indre lige s? ondt og ?kelt som dets ydre.&#8221;Frankenstein&#8221; er ikke bare en gruopv?kkende og hjems?gende gyser. Det er ogs? historien om et v?sen, der f?des med potentiale for det gode, men som en uforst?ende verden forvandler til et h?vngerrigt monster, og om et sk?bnesvangert b?nd mellem skaber og skabning, som ingen af dem form?r at bryde.I samarbejde med eReolen pr?senterer Saga Egmont &#8220;St?rke stemmer&#8221; &#8211; en lydbogsserie af klassiske titler indl?st af de bedste stemmer.

<p>Summary : In a bunker deep below Berlin&#8217;s Old Reich Chancellery, Adolf Hitler and his new bride, Eva Braun, took their own lives just after 3:00 p.m. on April 30, 1945-Hitler by gunshot to the temple, Braun by ingesting cyanide. But the F?hrer&#8217;s suicide did not instantly end either Nazism or the Second World War in Europe. Far from it: the eight days that followed were among the most traumatic in modern history, witnessing not only the final paroxysms of bloodshed and the frantic surrender of the Wehrmacht, but the total disintegration of the once-mighty Third Reich.In Eight Days in May, the award-winning historian and Hitler biographer Volker Ullrich draws on an astonishing variety of sources, including diaries and letters of ordinary Germans, to narrate a society&#8217;s descent into Hobbesian chaos. In the town of Demmin in the north, residents succumbed to madness and committed mass suicide. In Berlin, Soviet soldiers raped German civilians on a near-unprecedented scale. In Nazi-occupied Prague, </p>
