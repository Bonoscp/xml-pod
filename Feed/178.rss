<p>Summary : For readers of Helen Macdonald and Elizabeth Alexander, an intimate and haunting portrait of grief and the search for meaning from a singular new talent as told through the prism of three generations of her Chinese American family.Kat Chow has always been unusually fixated on death. She worried constantly about her parents dying&#8212;especially her mother. A vivacious and mischievous woman, Kat&#8217;s mother made a morbid joke that would haunt her for years to come: when she died, she&#8217;d like to be stuffed and displayed in Kat&#8217;s future apartment in order to always watch over her. After her mother dies unexpectedly from cancer, Kat, her sisters, and their father are plunged into a debilitating, lonely grief. With a distinct voice that is wry and heartfelt, Kat weaves together a story of the fallout of grief that follows her extended family as they emigrate from China and Hong Kong to Cuba and America.

And Finn has become that boy at school, the one everyone wants to be around.That still doesn&#8217;t stop the way Autumn feels every time she and Finn cross paths, and the growing, nagging thought that maybe things could have been different. Maybe they should be together.But come August, things will change forever. And as time passes, Autumn will be forced to confront how else life might have been different if they had never parted ways?</p>

<p>Summary : Un tenero viaggio nella relazione madre-figlioDalla penna di Alberto Pellai, celebre psicoterapeuta dell&#8217;et? evolutiva, una dolcissima storia in rima per raccontare ai bimbi e ai loro genitori il legame d&#8217;amore e attaccamento che li unisce nel tempo, e i suoi cambiamenti.

<p>Summary : La Peste es tal vez la obra m?s representativa de Albert Camus, novelista, dramaturgo y ensayista franc?s. Es una novela que narra la experiencia de una ciudad tras ser declarada en cuarentena a consecuencia de una epidemia de peste. De manera oportuna, la obra refleja como el desastre y la desgracia pueden aflorar los mejores sentimientos y actitudes de las personas para luchar y sobreponerse ante lo que consideran injusto. Albert Camus plasmo en este texto un retrato emocional de una comunidad sumergida en un entorno sombr?o y estremecedor, que podr?a ser trasladada a cualquier sociedad asolada por una cat?strofe.</p>

<p>Summary : Nash Morgan was always known as the good Morgan brother, with a smile and a wink for everyone. But now, this chief of police is recovering from being shot and his Southern charm has been overshadowed by panic attacks and nightmares. He feels like a broody shell of the man he once was. Nash isn?t about to let anyone in his life know he?s struggling. But his new next-door neighbor, smart and sexy Lina, sees his shadows. As a rule, she?s not a fan of physical contact unless she initiates it, but for some reason Nash?s touch is different. He feels it too. The physical connection between them is incendiary, grounding him and making her wonder if exploring it is worth the risk.Too bad Lina?s got secrets of her own, and if Nash finds out the real reason she?s in town, he?ll never forgive her. Besides, she doesn?t do relationships. Ever. A hot, short-term fling with a local cop? Absolutely. Sign her up. A relationship with a man who expects her to plant roots? No freaking way. Once she gets </p>

<p>Summary : Op de Olympische Winterspelen van 2022 wint Irene Schouten maar liefst drie gouden medailles en een bronzen ? een ongekend hoogtepunt. Maar de weg daarnaartoe is hobbelig en zwaar. Lange tijd overtuigt ze op de training en rijgt ze in marathons de zeges aan elkaar, maar weet ze op de langebaan, als het er echt om gaat, niet te presteren. Samen met haar coaches werkt Irene jarenlang onvermoeibaar om die frustrerende puzzel op te lossen. Met succes. Als ze begin 2024 afscheid neemt, doet ze dat met negen wereldtitels en drie keer olympisch goud op haar palmares.Gehard voor goud vertelt niet alleen het verhaal van Irenes ongekende talent, haar rotsvaste vertrouwen in haar coaches en de successen die daaruit voortvloeien, maar toont ook wat het publiek niet ziet. De grote tegenslag in haar priv?leven die Irene aan het wankelen brengt, moeilijke momenten vol onzekerheid en twijfel als de resultaten uitblijven, en eenzame momenten, alleen op een hotelkamer, ver van haar hechte familie. </p>

<p>Summary : We all grew up with Aesop?s fable of ?The Grasshopper and the Ant.? The grasshopper fiddled and enjoyed his days, while the ant worked assiduously to put his earnings aside for later in life. But suppose the takeaway lesson from that fable was wrong? Die with Zero is a startling new and provocative philosophy as well as practical guide on how to get the most out of your money?and out of?your life. It?s intended for those who place lifelong memorable experiences ahead of simply making the most of their savings. In the same vein as the classic bestsellers The 4-Hour Workweek and Die Broke, Bill Perkins offers a brand-new roadmap as to what?s the ideal age to transform your hard-earned savings into meaningful lifelong experiences. He makes it clear that you need to take stock of your life, and to understand that always postponing your dreams and wishes until you?re in your so-called Golden Years doesn?t make sense. In short, Perkins has turned the fable of ?The Grasshopper and the Ant? </p>

<p>Summary : In &#8216;De Zoete Zusjes gaan verhuizen?, geschreven door Hanneke de Zoete, gaan Saar en Janna verhuizen. Superleuk, maar ook een beetje spannend. Saar en Janna weten het zo net nog niet, met dat nieuwe huis. Zal het allemaal wel goedkomen?De Zoete Zusjes zitten met allerlei vragen. Voelt het nieuwe huis straks wel als thuis? Hoe zullen de nieuwe buren zijn? Kunnen alle knuffels wel meeverhuizen? Thuis is gewoon thuis. En straks wordt alles anders. Wie wil dat nou?Langzaam wordt het steeds toch iets leuker: in de tuin past een trampoline, en ze mogen zelf de kleur van hun nieuwe kamer kiezen. Maar wat valt daar over de heg? Een dennenappel? De nieuwe buren blijken twee echte stoute broertjes.</p>

<p>Summary : In &#8216;De Zoete Zusjes gaan verhuizen?, geschreven door Hanneke de Zoete, gaan Saar en Janna verhuizen. Superleuk, maar ook een beetje spannend. Saar en Janna weten het zo net nog niet, met dat nieuwe huis. Zal het allemaal wel goedkomen?De Zoete Zusjes zitten met allerlei vragen. Voelt het nieuwe huis straks wel als thuis? Hoe zullen de nieuwe buren zijn? Kunnen alle knuffels wel meeverhuizen? Thuis is gewoon thuis. En straks wordt alles anders. Wie wil dat nou?Langzaam wordt het steeds toch iets leuker: in de tuin past een trampoline, en ze mogen zelf de kleur van hun nieuwe kamer kiezen. Maar wat valt daar over de heg? Een dennenappel? De nieuwe buren blijken twee echte stoute broertjes.</p>

His staggering fortune was fought over by his heirs after his death in 1877, sowing familial discord that would never fully heal.

<p>Summary : The seductive and stunning #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Sarah J. Maas&#8217;s spellbinding A Court of Thorns and Roses .Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she&#8217;s now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre&#8217;s hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.Bestselling author Sarah J. </p>

<p>Summary : This poem first appeared in a newspaper in Troy, New York, USA, on December 23, 1823, as &#8220;A Visit From St. Nicholas&#8221;. No one claimed authorship until 13 years later. Clement Clarke Moore, a professor and poet, said that he wrote the piece for his children. Unbeknownst to him, his housekeeper had sent it to the newspaper to be published. However, the family of Henry Livingston Jr. contended that their father had been reciting ?A Visit from St. Nicholas? for 15 years prior to publication. Regardless of the true author, the poem is now a Christmas classic.</p>

<p>Summary : This poem first appeared in a newspaper in Troy, New York, USA, on December 23, 1823, as &#8220;A Visit From St. Nicholas&#8221;. No one claimed authorship until 13 years later. Clement Clarke Moore, a professor and poet, said that he wrote the piece for his children. Unbeknownst to him, his housekeeper had sent it to the newspaper to be published. However, the family of Henry Livingston Jr. contended that their father had been reciting ?A Visit from St. Nicholas? for 15 years prior to publication. Regardless of the true author, the poem is now a Christmas classic.</p>

<p>Summary : H? cinco anos um gato de rua foi acolhido por Satoru Miyawaki ap?s um acidente de carro. Ele deu ao gato o nome de Nana, ?sete? em japon?s, por conta de seu rabo dobrado em forma de 7. Mas agora, depois de anos de companhia, e por um motivo que ele n?o quer revelar, Satoru n?o poder? mais cuidar de Nana e precisa encontrar um novo lar para o gatinho. Para isso, ele entra em contato com seus melhores amigos da inf?ncia, do col?gio e da faculdade. Ao empreender uma viagem para reencontrar cada um deles, Satoru vai contando partes de sua pr?pria vida, e atrav?s desse percurso descobrimos como o amor de um gato por seu dono pode ser muito maior do que o esperado.Narrado em vozes alternadas, esse romance emocionante e divertido nos mostra um jovem de grande cora??o e um narrador-gato muito esperto, numa amizade que desafia as fronteiras de um pa?s e da pr?pria vida.</p>

I hope so, because I don&#8217;t think I can let her go.This book features:?? Arranged marriage?? She falls first, but he falls harder?? Angst, drama, groveling??

<p>Summary : Raymond Jaffe feels like he doesn&#8217;t belong. Not with his mother&#8217;s new family. Not as a weekend guest with his father and his father&#8217;s wife. Not at school, where he&#8217;s an outcast. After his best friend moves away, Raymond has only two real connections: to the feral cat he&#8217;s tamed and to a blind ninety-two-year-old woman in his building who&#8217;s introduced herself with a curious question: Have you seen Luis Velez?Mildred Gutermann, a German Jew who narrowly escaped the Holocaust, has been alone since her caretaker disappeared. She turns to Raymond for help, and as he tries to track Luis down, a deep and unexpected friendship blossoms between the two.Despondent at the loss of Luis, Mildred isolates herself further from a neighborhood devolving into bigotry and fear. Determined not to let her give up, Raymond helps her see that for every terrible act the world delivers, there is a mirror image of deep kindness, and Mildred helps Raymond see that there&#8217;s hope if you have someone to hold on to.</p>

<p>Summary : A magnificent history of the opening years of the Civil War by Pulitzer Prize?winning author Bruce Catton The first book in Bruce Catton?s Pulitzer Prize?winning Army of the Potomac Trilogy, Mr. Lincoln?s Army is a riveting history of the early years of the Civil War, when a fledgling Union Army took its stumbling first steps under the command of the controversial general George McClellan. Following the secession of the Southern states, a beleaguered President Abraham Lincoln entrusted the dashing, charismatic McClellan with the creation of the Union?s Army of the Potomac and the responsibility of leading it to a swift and decisive victory against Robert E. Lee?s Army of Northern Virginia. Although a brilliant tactician who was beloved by his troops and embraced by the hero-hungry North, McClellan?s ego and ambition ultimately put him at loggerheads with his commander in chief?a man McClellan considered unworthy of the presidency.

Nesses textos, o leitor se defronta com um narrador inquisitivo que exp?e, com eleg?ncia e economia de meios, de forma paradoxal e lapidar, suas conjecturas e perplexidades sobre o universo, retomando motivos recorrentes em seus poemas e ensaios desde o in?cio de sua carreira: o tempo, a eternidade, o infinito. Os enredos s?o como m?ltiplos labirintos e se desdobram num jogo infind?vel de espelhos, especula??es e hip?teses, ?s vezes com a per?cia de intrigas policiais e o gosto da aventura, para quase sempre desembocar na perplexidade metaf?sica.

<p>Summary : A candid examination of the life of North Sea oil riggers, and an explosive portrayal of masculinity, loneliness and female desire.In her mid-30s and sprung out of a terrible relationship, Tabitha quit her job at a women?s magazine, left London and put her savings into a six-month lease on a flat in a dodgy neighbourhood in Aberdeen ? she was going to make good on a long-deferred idea for a book about oil rigs and the men who work on them. Why oil rigs? ?I wanted to see what men were like, with no women around.?Sea State is, on the one hand, a portrait of an overlooked industry, and a fascinating subculture in its own right: ?offshore? is a way of life for generations of British workers, primarily working class men.

<p>Summary : From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an intimate and charming memoir of life in and out of the kitchen.Before Stanley Tucci became a household name with The Devil Wears Prada, The Hunger Games, and the perfect Negroni, he grew up in an Italian American family that spent every night around the table. He shared the magic of those meals with us in The Tucci Cookbook and The Tucci Table, and now he takes us beyond the recipes and into the stories behind them.Taste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with anecdotes about growing up in Westchester, New York, preparing for and filming the foodie films Big Night and Julie &amp; Julia, falling in love over dinner, and teaming up with his wife to create conversation-starting meals for their children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and burnt dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.Written with Stanley&#8217;s signature wry humour and </p>

<p>Summary : This final, essential chapter in Rex Ogle?s memoir trilogy recounts being forced from his home and living on the streets after his conservative father discovered he was gay. When Rex was outed the summer after he graduated high school, his father gave him a choice: he could stay at home, find a girlfriend, and attend church twice a week, or he could be gay?and leave. Rex left, driving toward the only other gay man he knew and a toxic relationship that would ultimately leave him homeless and desperate on the streets of New Orleans. Here, Rex tells the story of his coming out and his father?s rejection of his identity, navigating abuse and survival on the streets. Road Home is a devastating and incandescent reflection on Rex?s hunger?for food, for love, and for a place to call home?completing the trilogy of memoirs that began with the award-winning Free Lunch .</p>

<p>Summary : The New York Times bestselling author of The Year of Living Biblically chronicles his hilarious adventures in attempting to follow the original meaning of the Constitution, as he searches for answers to one of the most pressing issues of our time: How should we interpret America?s foundational document?A.J. Jacobs learned the hard way that donning a tricorne hat and marching around Manhattan with a 1700s musket will earn you a lot of strange looks. In the wake of several controversial rulings by the Supreme Court and the on-going debate about how the Constitution should be interpreted, Jacobs set out to understand what it means to live by the Constitution.In The Year of Living Constitutionally, A.J. Jacobs tries to get inside the minds of the Founding Fathers by living as closely as possible to the original meaning of the Constitution.

<p>Summary : The human brain is made up of 85 billion neurons, which are connected by over 100 trillion synapses. For more than a century, a diverse array of researchers searched for a language that could be used to capture the essence of what these neurons do and how they communicate ? and how those communications create thoughts, perceptions and actions. The language they were looking for was mathematics, and we would not be able to understand the brain as we do today without it.In Models of the Mind, author and computational neuroscientist Grace Lindsay explains how mathematical models have allowed scientists to understand and describe many of the brain&#8217;s processes, including decision-making, sensory processing, quantifying memory, and more. She introduces readers to the most important concepts in modern neuroscience, and highlights the tensions that arise when the abstract world of mathematical modelling collides with the messy details of biology.Each chapter of Models of the Mind focuses on </p>

Grandi manifestazioni chiedevano a gran voce le dimissioni di Netanyahu e del suo governo e il paese era praticamente bloccato. La risposta al gesto terroristico di Hamas con la guerra di Gaza rischia per? di essere un vero e proprio suicidio per Israele.

<p>Summary : Sharon Stone, one of the most renowned actresses in the world, suffered a massive stroke that cost her not only her health, but her career, family, fortune, and global fame. In The Beauty of Living Twice, Stone chronicles her efforts to rebuild her life and writes about her slow road back to wholeness and health. In a business that doesn?t accept failure, in a world where too many voices are silenced, Stone found the power to return, the courage to speak up, and the will to make a difference in the lives of men, women, and children around the globe.Over the course of these intimate pages, as candid as a personal conversation, Stone talks about her pivotal roles, her life-changing friendships, her worst disappointments, and her greatest accomplishments.

She describes the strength and meaning she found in her </p>

In Black Flags, an unprecedented character-driven account of the rise of ISIS, Joby Warrick shows how the zeal of this one man and the strategic mistakes of Western governments led to the banner of ISIS being raised over huge swathes of Syria and Iraq.Zarqawi began by directing terror attacks from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the allied invasion in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By falsely identifying him as the link between </p>

<p>Summary : With all his family and friends gone, one-hundred-year-old Murray McBride is looking for a reason to live. He finds it in Jason Cashman, a ten-year-old boy with a terminal heart defect and a list of five things he wants to do before he dies. Together, they race against the limited time each has left, ticking off wishes one by one. Along the way, Murray remembers what it&#8217;s like to be young, and Jason fights for the opportunity to grow old. But when tragedy strikes, their worlds are turned upside-down, and an unexpected gift is the only thing that can make Jason&#8217;s final wish come true.</p>

<p>Summary : Indo contra a tend?ncia dos textos curtos e superficiais que s?o postados nas redes sociais, o coletivo liter?rio Textos cru?is demais para serem lidos rapidamente (TCD) passou a produzir e compartilhar um conte?do extenso, profundo e extremamente po?tico em suas p?ginas no Facebook e no Instagram. Com seus escritos e ilustra??es, eles acabaram atingindo um p?blico muito maior do que o esperado, nos mostrando como, apesar da crescente agilidade que nossa comunica??o exige, ainda precisamos de tempo para digerir e entender nossas complexas rela??es humanas. Para este livro, foram produzidos textos in?ditos que ganharam a companhia das sens?veis ilustra??es de An?lia Moraes.</p>

<p>Summary : Indo contra a tend?ncia dos textos curtos e superficiais que s?o postados nas redes sociais, o coletivo liter?rio Textos cru?is demais para serem lidos rapidamente (TCD) passou a produzir e compartilhar um conte?do extenso, profundo e extremamente po?tico em suas p?ginas no Facebook e no Instagram. Com seus escritos e ilustra??es, eles acabaram atingindo um p?blico muito maior do que o esperado, nos mostrando como, apesar da crescente agilidade que nossa comunica??o exige, ainda precisamos de tempo para digerir e entender nossas complexas rela??es humanas. Para este livro, foram produzidos textos in?ditos que ganharam a companhia das sens?veis ilustra??es de An?lia Moraes.</p>

<p>Summary : Length: 10 hrs and 16 minsFor fans of The Silent Patient and Gone Girl, a razor-sharp and Hitchcock-inspired psychological thriller about two ordinary women who make a dangerous pact to take revenge for each other after being pushed to the brink. One dark evening on New York City?s Upper West Side, two strangers meet by chance. Over drinks, Amanda and Wendy realize they have much in common, especially loneliness and an intense desire for revenge against the men who destroyed their families. As they talk into the night, they come up with the perfect plan: if you kill for me, I?ll kill for you.In another part of the city, Ruth is home alone when the beautiful brownstone she shares with her husband, Scott, is invaded. She?s attacked by a man with piercing blue eyes, who disappears into the night. Will she ever be able to feel safe again while the blue-eyed stranger is out there?Intricate, heart-racing, and from an author who ?is the real deal? (Lee Child, #1 New York Times bestselling </p>

<p>Summary : El periodista Fernando Navarro ha escrito, despu?s de a?os de entrevistas con los cuatro protagonistas y todo su entorno, la bella y conmovedora historia de Supersubmarina: el relato de su ?xito y su tragedia.Esta es la historia de cuatro amigos que subieron al cielo y bajaron a los infiernos. Cuatro ni?os que empezaron jugando al f?tbol bajo el sol en el paseo de la Constituci?n de Baeza y que acabaron jugando a hacer m?sica con su propio grupo en el quiosco de ese mismo paseo bajo la luna pocos a?os despu?s. Un relato acerca de c?mo los sue?os se hacen realidad, pero tambi?n de su fragilidad.Supersubmarina ha sido y es una de las grandes bandas de pop-rock nacional de las ?ltimas d?cadas.

<p>Summary : El periodista Fernando Navarro ha escrito, despu?s de a?os de entrevistas con los cuatro protagonistas y todo su entorno, la bella y conmovedora historia de Supersubmarina: el relato de su ?xito y su tragedia.Esta es la historia de cuatro amigos que subieron al cielo y bajaron a los infiernos. Cuatro ni?os que empezaron jugando al f?tbol bajo el sol en el paseo de la Constituci?n de Baeza y que acabaron jugando a hacer m?sica con su propio grupo en el quiosco de ese mismo paseo bajo la luna pocos a?os despu?s. Un relato acerca de c?mo los sue?os se hacen realidad, pero tambi?n de su fragilidad.Supersubmarina ha sido y es una de las grandes bandas de pop-rock nacional de las ?ltimas d?cadas.

<p>Summary : The Roman Republic was the most remarkable state in history. What began as a small community of peasants camped among marshes and hills ended up ruling the known world. Rubicon paints a vivid portrait of the Republic at the climax of its greatness &#8211; the same greatness which would herald the catastrophe of its fall. It is a story of incomparable drama. This was the century of Julius Caesar, the gambler whose addiction to glory led him to the banks of the Rubicon, and beyond; of Cicero, whose defence of freedom would make him a byword for eloquence; of Spartacus, the slave who dared to challenge a superpower; of Cleopatra, the queen who did the same. Tom Holland brings to life this strange and unsettling civilization, with its extremes of ambition and self-sacrifice, bloodshed and desire. Yet alien as it was, the Republic still holds up a mirror to us. Its citizens were obsessed by celebrity chefs, all-night dancing and exotic pets; they fought elections in law courts and were addicted </p>

From growing up in a rough-and-tumble childhood in Queens with his big and loving Italian-American family to where he is now, Nyle has always been driven to explore beyond the boundaries given him.A college math major and athlete at Gallaudet&#8211;the famed university for the Deaf in Washington, DC&#8211;Nyle was drawn as a young man to acting, and dove </p>
