<p>Summary : Doing well with money isn&#8217;t necessarily about what you know. It&#8217;s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money&#8211;investing, personal finance, and business decisions&#8211;is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don&#8217;t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life&#8217;s most important topics.</p>

<p>Summary : There are canyons all over the planet, and the Grand Canyon in Arizona is not the biggest. Yet because of the spectacular colors in the rock layers and fascinating formations of boulders, buttes, and mesas, it is known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. Starting with a brief overview of how national parks came into being, this book covers all aspects of the canyon&#8211;how it formed, which early native people lived there, and what varied wildlife can be found there now. A history of the canyon&#8217;s end-to-end exploration in the late 1860s and how the Grand Canyon became such a popular vacation spot (5 million tourists visit every year) round out this informative, easy-to-read account.</p>

<p>Summary : It?s a blazing summer when two men arrive in a small village in the West of Ireland. One of them is coming home. Both of them are coming to get rich. One of them is coming to die.Cal Hooper took early retirement from Chicago PD and moved to rural Ireland looking for peace. He?s found it, more or less: he?s built a relationship with a local woman, Lena, and he?s gradually turning Trey Reddy from a half-feral teenager into a good kid going good places. But then Trey?s long-absent father reappears, bringing along an English millionaire and a scheme to find gold in the townland, and suddenly everything the three of them have been building is under threat. Cal and Lena are both ready to do whatever it takes to protect Trey, but Trey doesn?t want protecting. What she wants is revenge.A nuanced, atmospheric tale that explores what we?ll do for our loved ones, what we?ll do for revenge, and what we sacrifice when the two collide.</p>

<p>Summary : El horrible crimen perpetrado en Mosc? a finales de 1869 siguiendo ?rdenes del nihilista Nech?yev, seguidor de Bakunin, fue la fuente de inspiraci?n que sirvi? a Fi?dor Dostoyevski (1821-1881) para construir la trama argumental y perfilar los caracteres de los principales personajes de ?Los demonios?. Entre ellos destaca con fuerza Nikolai Stavrogin, figura atormentada que casi un siglo despu?s habr?a de fascinar a Albert Camus y que introduce en la novela una dimensi?n teol?gica y metaf?sica que la lleva mucho m?s all? de la mera reconstrucci?n de la historia o de la diatriba pol?tica, propiciando el salto cualitativo que hace de esta obra sin duda una las m?s destacadas del gran autor ruso.~alianzaeditorial.es</p>

<p>Summary : Melissa Gould?s uplifting and deeply moving memoir of grieving outside the box and the surprising nature of love.When Melissa Gould&#8217;s husband, Joel, was unexpectedly hospitalized, she could not imagine how her life was about to change. Overwhelmed with uncertainty as Joel&#8217;s condition tragically worsened, she offered him the only thing she could: he love and devotion. Her dedication didn&#8217;t end with his death.Left to resume life without her beloved husband and their young daughter on her own, Melissa soon realized that her and Joel&#8217;s love lived on. Meliss found that she didn?t fit the typical mold of widowhood or meet the expectations of mourning. She didn?t look like a widow or act like a widow, but she felt like one. Melissa was widowish.Melissa?s personal journey through grief and beyond illuminates the twists of fate that break our world, the determination that keeps us moving forward, and the surprises in life we never see coming. A modern take on loss, &#8216;WIDOWISH&#8217; reminds us that </p>

<p>Summary : Kafka on the Shore is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.As their paths converge, and the reasons for that convergence become clear, Haruki Murakami enfolds readers in a world where cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to make love or commit murder. Kafka on the Shore display one of the world&#8217;s great story tellers at the peak of his powers.</p>

<p>Summary : Becoming a Barbarian is a follow-up to Donovan&#8217;s cult hit, The Way of Men. Good, modern, &#8220;civilized&#8221; Western men today are expected to think like &#8220;citizens of the world&#8221; ? obligated to everyone and no one. Natural, meaningful tribal connections have been substituted with synthetic, disposable consumer identities. Without a sense of who they are and what group they have a place in, modern men are becoming increasingly detached, disoriented, vulnerable, and ever more easily manipulated. Becoming a Barbarian attacks the emasculated emptiness of life in the modern West ? &#8220;The Empire of Nothing&#8221; ? and shows men how to think tribally again. It reveals the weaknesses of universalistic thinking, and challenges readers to become the kind of men who could go &#8220;all-in&#8221; and devote their lives to one group of people above all others. Becoming a Barbarian is about finding a tribe, finding a purpose, and choosing to live the kind of life that undermines the narrative of the Empire.</p>

<p>Summary : This book is about pleasure. It&#8217;s also about pain. Most important, it&#8217;s about how to find the delicate balance between the two, and why now more than ever finding balance is essential. We&#8217;re living in a time of unprecedented access to high-reward, high-dopamine stimuli: drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting&#8230; The increased numbers, variety, and potency is staggering. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation. As such we&#8217;ve all become vulnerable to compulsive overconsumption.In Dopamine Nation, Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist and author, explores the exciting new scientific discoveries that explain why the relentless pursuit of pleasure leads to pain&#8230;and what to do about it. Condensing complex neuroscience into easy-to-understand metaphors, Lembke illustrates how finding contentment and connectedness means keeping dopamine in check. The lived </p>

<p>Summary : A modern-day Ohio woman and a seventeenth-century Scottish laird fall in love at first sight in a magical holiday romance by Sariah Wilson, the bestselling author of The Chemistry of Love.Maren Kelly and her friend Penny may be lost in the Scottish Highlands, yes. They may be caught in the blizzard of the century, sure. But despite their dire straits, Maren is going to honor her ailing mother?s wish for them to experience all the magic, mystery, and whimsy Scotland has to offer, even if she freezes to death trying. When they?re rescued by the dashing Duncan Campbell, who seems like he walked straight out of the seventeenth century, Maren is more than a wee bit bewildered.Their shelter is Duncan?s castle in Highglen, a captivating village that feels somehow familiar?as does the laird himself. Brimming with holiday cheer and friendly, boisterous family members, Highglen is a safe haven in the frigid winter storm. Maybe it?s the carolers and the warm hearth?or Duncan?s comforting brogue </p>

<p>Summary : Written in Greek, without any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus&#8217; own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries.</p>

<p>Summary : A standalone enemies-to-lovers, marriage of convenience romance. I fell for the villain.It happened back when I was a clueless girl.But he ruthlessly broke my heart and trapped it in a jar.Since then, I?ve sworn to hate him to the end of my days.Eli King might be a savage devil, but I?m out of his way. And league. That is until I wake up in a hospital and find him holding my hand.He tells me the words that change my life forever.?We got married two years ago, Mrs. King.?So I set out to investigate how I landed myself into this marriage.Turns out, my memories are darker than my present. I thought I was ready for the hurricane.I thought I could handle his soulless eyes and cold shoulder.I thought wrong.Nothing can stop my husband.Not the secrets surrounding us.Not the hatred between us.Not even me. This book can be read on its own, but for a better understanding of the world, you might want to start with God of Malice.</p>

<p>Summary : In this funny romantic series, the Shackleford sisters descend on a Regency society that doesn?t know what?s hit it?Reverend Shackleford was at a loss. He?d truly believed that in marrying his eldest daughter Grace to an extremely wealthy peer of the realm, his problems would be over.

<p>Summary : An epic novel of determination, survival, and the limits of the human spirit. This is Tim Winton as you?ve never read him before.Two fugitives, a man and a child, drive all night across a stony desert. As dawn breaks, they roll into an abandoned mine site. From the vehicle they survey a forsaken place ? middens of twisted iron, rusty wire, piles of sun-baked trash. They?re exhausted, traumatised, desperate now. But as a refuge, this is the most promising place they?ve seen. The child peers at the field of desolation. The man thinks to himself, this could work.Problem is, they?re not alone.So begins a searing, propulsive journey through a life whose central challenge is not simply a matter of survival, but of how to maintain human decency as everyone around you falls ever further into barbarism.</p>

<p>Summary : China&#8217;s great classic novel Outlaws of the Marsh, written in the fourteenth century, is a fictional account of twelfth-century events during the Song Dynasty.

<p>Summary : In The Comfort of Crows, Margaret Renkl presents a literary devotional: fifty-two chapters that follow the creatures and plants in her backyard over the course of a year. As we move through the seasons?from a crow spied on New Year?s Day, its resourcefulness and sense of community setting a theme for the year, to the lingering bluebirds of December, revisiting the nest box they used in spring?what develops is a portrait of joy and grief: joy in the ongoing pleasures of the natural world, and grief over winters that end too soon and songbirds that grow fewer and fewer.  Along the way, we also glimpse the changing rhythms of a human life. Grown children, unexpectedly home during the pandemic, prepare to depart once more. Birdsong and night-blooming flowers evoke generations past. The city and the country where Renkl raised her family transform a little more with each passing day. And the natural world, now in visible flux, requires every ounce of hope and commitment from the author?and </p>

<p>Summary : A gentle reminder, for the days you feel light in this world, and for the days in which the sun rises a little slower. A gentle reminder for when your heart is full of hope, and for when you are learning how to heal it. A gentle reminder for when you finally begin to trust in the goodness, and for when you need the kind of words that hug your broken pieces back together. A gentle reminder for when growth hangs heavy in the air, for when you need to tuck your strength into your bones just to make it to tomorrow. A gentle reminder for when you are balancing the messiness, and the beauty, of what it means to be human, when you are teaching yourself that it is okay to be both happy and sad, that you are real, not perfect. A gentle reminder for when you seek the words you needed when you were younger. A gentle reminder for when you need to hear that you deserve to be loved the way you love others.

<p>Summary : Ian Fleming?s twelfth James Bond novel.The tragic end to James Bond?s last mission ? courtesy of Ernst Stavro Blofeld ? has left 007 a broken man and of little use to the British Secret Service.At his wit?s end, M decides that the only way to snap his best agent out of his torpor is to send him on an impossible diplomatic mission to Japan. Bond?s contact there is the formidable Japanese spymaster Tiger Tanaka, who agrees to do business with the West if Bond will assassinate one of his enemies: a mysterious Swiss botanist named Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Shatterhand is not who he seems, however, and his impregnable fortress ? known to the locals as the ?Castle of Death? ? is a gauntlet of traps no gaijin has ever penetrated.But through rigorous ninja training, and with some help from the beautiful and able Kissy Suzuki, Bond manages to gain access to Shatterhand?s lair. Inside lurks certain doom at the hands of 007?s bitterest foe ? or a final chance to exact ultimate vengeance.</p>

Prejudice is taboo, and diversity is strongly valued. At the same time, social and economic inequality have exploded. In We Have Never Been Woke, Musa al-Gharbi argues that these trends are closely related, each tied to the rise of a new elite?the symbolic capitalists. In education, media, nonprofits, and beyond, members of this elite work primarily with words, ideas, images, and data, and are very likely to identify as allies of antiracist, feminist, LGBTQ, and other progressive causes. Their dominant ideology is ?wokeness? and, while their commitment to equality is sincere, they actively benefit from and perpetuate the inequalities they decry. Indeed, their egalitarian credentials help them gain more power and status, often at the expense of the marginalized and disadvantaged.We Have Never Been </p>

<p>Summary : A haunting and powerful story of female friendships and secrets in a Washington, D.C. boardinghouse during the McCarthy era. Washington, D.C., 1950. Everyone keeps to themselves at Briarwood House, a down-at-the-heels all-female boardinghouse in the heart of the nation?s capital, where secrets hide behind white picket fences.

Grace?s weekly attic-room dinner parties and window-brewed sun tea become a healing balm on all their lives, but she hides a terrible secret of her own. When a shocking act </p>

<p>Summary : How many colours are there? In the West we see seven, but the Chinese see five, while the Pirah? tribe in the Amazon have no words for the spectrum. Colour isn&#8217;t something we see; it&#8217;s something we think.In this popular culture miscellany, Paul Simpson takes eleven key colours and explores how they have shaped our evolution as a species, persuaded us in politics and culture and allowed us to express or oppress personal freedoms. His book investigates such issues as the shifting gender of pink, the poisonous potential of green, the decadence of yellow, the performance-diminishing impact of grey and the ways in which orange has shaped power in Europe.</p>

<p>Summary : In Rough Sleepers, Tracy Kidder shows how one person can make a difference, as he tells the story of Dr. Jim O?Connell, a man who invented ways to create a community of care for a city?s unhoused population, including those who sleep on the streets?the ?rough sleepers.?  When Jim O?Connell graduated from Harvard Medical School and was nearing the end of his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, the chief of medicine made a proposal: Would he defer a prestigious fellowship and spend a year helping to create an organization to bring health care to homeless citizens? Jim took the job because he felt he couldn?t refuse. But that year turned into his life?s calling. Tracy Kidder spent five years following Dr. O?Connell and his colleagues as they served their thousands of homeless patients.

He emphasizes a </p>

Vodka, beer, peppermint schnapps?alcohol smooths the sharp edges of Bella?s life. And what?s the big deal? Everyone drinks. Besides, Bella can stop whenever she wants.

<p>Summary : A revisionist, completely accessible and radically inclusive history of mathsMathematics shapes almost everything we do. But despite its reputation as the study of fundamental truths, the stories we have been told about it are wrong. In The Secret Lives of Numbers, historian Kate Kitagawa and journalist Timothy Revell introduce readers to the mathematical boundary-smashers who have been erased by history because of their race, gender or nationality.From the brilliant Arabic scholars of the ninth-century House of Wisdom, and the pioneering African American mathematicians of the twentieth century, to the &#8216;lady computers&#8217; around the world who revolutionised our knowledge of the night sky, we meet these fascinating trailblazers and see how they contributed to our global knowledge today.This revisionist, completely accessible and radically inclusive history of mathematics is as entertaining as it is important.</p>

<p>Summary : En este cl?sico de las finanzas, con m?s de un mill?n de ejemplares vendidos en todo el mundo, el m?tico inversor Peter Lynch describe su m?todo para alcanzar el ?xito financiero. Seg?n Lynch, los inversores no profesionales pueden ganar a los profesionales usando simplemente la informaci?n a su alcance, dado que las oportunidades de inversi?n est?n en todas partes. A lo largo del d?a, desde el supermercado hasta nuestro lugar de trabajo, nos encontramos con un sinf?n de productos y servicios. Y si prestamos atenci?n a los mejores estaremos sobre la pista de cu?les son las empresas en las que invertir antes de que los inversores profesionales lo descubran. Si los inversores se adelantan pueden dar con las anheladas 10-baggers, el t?rmino usado en Wall Street para las acciones con las que se ha ganado diez veces el dinero invertido. Unas pocas 10-baggers bastan para convertir una cartera de acciones correcta en una cartera estrella. Asimismo, Lynch ofrece consejos f?ciles de inversi?n </p>

<p>Summary : An explosive new novel brimming with love, secrets, and enchantment The Fall siblings live in hot Northern California wine country, where the sun pours out of the sky, and the devil winds blow so hard they whip the sense right out of your head. Years ago, the Fall kids? father mysteriously disappeared, cracking the family into pieces. Now Dizzy Fall, age twelve, bakes cakes, sees spirits, and wishes she were a heroine of a romance novel.

<p>Summary : Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this piercing work distills three thousand years of the history of power in to forty-eight well explicated laws. As attention-grabbing in its design as it is in its content, this bold volume outlines the laws of power in their unvarnished essence, synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great thinkers. Some laws teach the need for prudence (&#8220;Law 1: Never Outshine the Master&#8221;), the virtue of stealth (&#8220;Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions&#8221;), and many demand the total absence of mercy (&#8220;Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally&#8221;), but like it or not, all have applications in real life. Illustrated through the tactics of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, P. T. Barnum, and other famous figures who have wielded&#8211;or been victimized by&#8211;power, these laws will fascinate any reader interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.</p>

<p>Summary : In her groundbreaking and essential debut The Three Mothers, scholar Anna Malaika Tubbs celebrates Black motherhood by telling the story of the three women who raised and shaped some of America&#8217;s most pivotal heroes: Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and James Baldwin.Much has been written about Berdis Baldwin&#8217;s son James, about Alberta King&#8217;s son Martin Luther, and Louise Little&#8217;s son Malcolm. But virtually nothing has been said about the extraordinary women who raised them, who were all born at the beginning of the 20th century and forced to contend with the prejudices of Jim Crow as Black women.Berdis, Alberta, and Louise passed their knowledge to their children with the hope of helping them to survive in a society that would deny their humanity from the very beginning&#8211;from Louise teaching her children about their activist roots, to Berdis encouraging James to express himself through writing, to Alberta basing all of her lessons in faith and social justice.

When tragedy befalls Imperial Prince Taam, his Thean widower, Jainan, is rushed into an arranged marriage with Taam&#8217;s cousin, the disreputable Kiem, in a bid to keep the rising hostilities between the two worlds under control.But when it comes to light that Prince Taam&#8217;s death may not have been an accident, and that Jainan himself may be a suspect, the unlikely pair must overcome their misgivings and learn to trust one another as they navigate the perils of the Iskat court, try to solve a murder, and prevent an interplanetary war&#8230; all while dealing with their growing feelings for each other.</p>

<p>Summary : His last challenge: live long enough to save the lives of those he loves.Cold-blooded killer JimBone Wheeler blames Tom McMurtrie for putting him on death row. He once vowed that he?d bring ?a reckoning? on Tom and everyone the southern lawyer holds dear. When Wheeler escapes from prison, he aims to fulfill his promise. Victim by victim, he?s getting closer to his ultimate target. But for Tom, who?s dying of cancer, the role of savior and protector is a struggle that is becoming more desperate by the hour.As the body count mounts, Tom, his partner, Rick Drake, and his best friend, Bocephus Haynes, brace for a confrontation like nothing they have ever faced before. This battle will be waged not in a courthouse but on the streets and fields of north Alabama. With all those he loves at risk, Tom must save his family, his friends, and his legacy from a killer whose hunger for retribution knows no bounds.Now, as time ticks down and fate and vengeance close in, who will survive Wheeler?s </p>

<p>Summary : Questa nuova edizione rivista del manuale modifica alcuni punti della trattazione, eliminando dettagli non necessari e aggiungendo nozioni e precisazioni utili per una pi? completa visuale della materia. Viene quindi aggiornata e migliorata la copertura, a livello introduttivo, dei principali settori della disciplina, mentre ? mantenuto l?obiettivo di fornire una presentazione di base semplice e accessibile che coniughi rigore scientifico, chiarezza di esposizione e plausibilit? didattica per principianti nella materia, in particolare di corsi di primo livello. L?abbondanza di esercizi e lo spazio relativamente ampio concesso ad alcuni concetti e ambiti tematici, e soprattutto la presenza di numerosi box con dettagli e approfondimenti su singoli temi, favoriscono peraltro l?utilizzazione del volume anche in corsi magistrali.

<p>Summary : THE all-time classic story, from generation to generation, sold somewhere in the world every 30 seconds! Have you shared it with a child or grandchild in your life? One sunny Sunday, the caterpillar was hatched out of a tiny egg. He was very hungry. On Monday, he ate through one apple; on Tuesday, he ate through three plums&#8211;and still he was hungry. When full at last, he made a cocoon around himself and went to sleep, to wake up a few weeks later wonderfully transformed into a butterfly!The brilliantly innovative Eric Carle has dramatized the story of one of Nature&#8217;s commonest yet loveliest marvels, the metamorphosis of the butterfly. This audiobook will delight as well as instruct the very youngest listener.</p>

On a quiet corner in an old wooden building lies a shop filled with hundreds of second-hand books,Twenty-five-year-old Takako has never liked reading, although the Morisaki bookshop has been in her family for three generations. It is the pride and joy of her uncle Satoru, who has devoted his life to the bookshop since his wife Momoko left him five years earlier.When Takako&#8217;s boyfriend reveals he&#8217;s marrying someone else, she reluctantly accepts her eccentric uncle&#8217;s offer to live rent-free in the tiny room above the shop. Hoping to nurse her broken heart in peace, Takako is surprised to encounter new worlds within the stacks of books lining the Morisaki bookshop.As summer fades to autumn, Satoru and Takako discover they have more in common than they first thought. The Morisaki bookshop has something to teach them both about life, love, and the healing power of books.</p>
