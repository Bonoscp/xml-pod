<p>Summary : Point, click, die.When two hikers disappear, their hometown in Maine blames the blinding storms. But the truth is far more sinister. Unaware of the danger, tabloid photographer Jayne Sullivan follows an anonymous tip to find the most reclusive sculptor in the art world. Instead, she finds sexy handyman Reed Kimball?and a small town full of fatal secrets.Five years ago, Reed buried his homicide detective career along with his wife. But when a hiker is found dead, the local police chief asks Reed for help. Why was a Celtic coin found under the body? And where is the second hiker? Avoiding the media, Reed doesn?t need a murder, a missing person, or a nosey photographer. Then Jayne is attacked, and her courage is his undoing. Reed must risk everything to protect her &#8211; and find a cunning killer.</p>

<p>Summary : To live and dream is a wicked dance.My dreams often come true &#8212; a curse, and a blessing.Pamela Anderson&#8217;s blond bombshell image was ubiquitous in the 1990s. Discovered in the stands during a Canadian football game, she was quickly launched into superstardom, becoming Playboy&#8217;s favorite cover girl and an emblem of Hollywood glamour and sex appeal. Yet the Pamela Anderson we think we know was created through happenstance rather than careful cultivation. Love, Pamela brings forth her true story: that of a small-town girl getting tangled up in her own dream.Growing up on Vancouver Island, the daughter of young, wild, and unwittingly stylish parents, Pamela lived a hardscrabble childhood but developed a deep love for nature, populating her world with misfits, apparitional friends, and injured animals.

<p>Summary : To live and dream is a wicked dance.My dreams often come true &#8212; a curse, and a blessing.Pamela Anderson&#8217;s blond bombshell image was ubiquitous in the 1990s. Discovered in the stands during a Canadian football game, she was quickly launched into superstardom, becoming Playboy&#8217;s favorite cover girl and an emblem of Hollywood glamour and sex appeal. Yet the Pamela Anderson we think we know was created through happenstance rather than careful cultivation. Love, Pamela brings forth her true story: that of a small-town girl getting tangled up in her own dream.Growing up on Vancouver Island, the daughter of young, wild, and unwittingly stylish parents, Pamela lived a hardscrabble childhood but developed a deep love for nature, populating her world with misfits, apparitional friends, and injured animals. Eventually overcoming her natural shyness, Pamela&#8217;s restless imagination propelled her into a life few can dream of, from the beaches of Malibu to the coveted scene at the Playboy Mansion. </p>

<p>Summary : A new memoir and collection of love poems by?#1?New York Times?bestselling author and Newbery Medalist Kwame Alexander. In a powerfully intimate and non-traditional (or &#8220;new-fashioned&#8221;) memoir, Kwame Alexander shares snapshots of a man learning how to love. He takes us through stories of his parents: from being awkward newlyweds in the sticky Chicago summer of 1967, to the sometimes-confusing ways they showed their love to each other, and for him. He explores his own relationships?his difficulties as a newly wedded, 22-year-old father, and the precariousness of his early marriage working in a jazz club with his second wife.

<p>Summary : A new memoir and collection of love poems by?#1?New York Times?bestselling author and Newbery Medalist Kwame Alexander. In a powerfully intimate and non-traditional (or &#8220;new-fashioned&#8221;) memoir, Kwame Alexander shares snapshots of a man learning how to love. He takes us through stories of his parents: from being awkward newlyweds in the sticky Chicago summer of 1967, to the sometimes-confusing ways they showed their love to each other, and for him. He explores his own relationships?his difficulties as a newly wedded, 22-year-old father, and the precariousness of his early marriage working in a jazz club with his second wife. Alexander attempts to deal with the unravelling of his marriage and the grief of his mother&#8217;s recent passing while sharing the solace he found in learning how to perfect her famous fried chicken dish. With an open heart, Alexander weaves together memories of his past to try and understand his greatest love: his daughters. Full of heartfelt reminisces, family </p>

<p>Summary : Finalist ? National Book Critics Circle Award [Biography]A stunning counternarrative of the legendary abolitionist Grimke sisters that finally reclaims the forgotten Black members of their family.Sarah and Angelina Grimke?the Grimke sisters?are revered figures in American history, famous for rejecting their privileged lives on a plantation in South Carolina to become firebrand activists in the North.

In The Grimkes , award-winning historian Kerri Greenidge presents a parallel narrative, indeed a long-overdue corrective, shifting the focus from the white abolitionist sisters to the Black Grimkes and deepening our understanding of the long struggle for racial and gender equality.That the Grimke sisters had Black relatives in the first place was a consequence of slavery?s most horrific reality.

<p>Summary : An electric and unforgettable memoir about a young woman&#8217;s journey?from the ice rink, to addiction and a prison sentence, to the newsroom?and how she emerged with a fierce determination to expose the broken system she experienced.An elite, competitive figure skater growing up, Keri Blakinger poured herself into the sport, even competing at nationals. But when her skating partnership ended abruptly, her world shattered. With all the intensity she saved for the ice, she dove into self-destruction. From her first taste of heroin, the next nine years would be a blur?living on the streets, digging for a vein, selling drugs and sex, eventually plunging off a bridge when it all became too much, all while trying to hold herself together enough to finish her degree at Cornell.Then, on a cold day during Keri&#8217;s senior year, the police stopped her. Caught with a Tupperware container full of heroin, she was arrested and ushered into a holding cell, a county jail, and finally into state prison. </p>

<p>Summary : An intimate look at the life and music of modern pop?s most legendary figure, Taylor Swift, from leading music journalist Rob Sheffield.As Taylor Swift?s preferred and most trusted music journalist, Rob Sheffield has enjoyed closer access to the mega-star than any other writer working today. His unique insight has afforded him a singular perspective of Taylor?s world and her impact on the world. Inspired by his years of exclusive access, and the Swiftie response to his commentary on their beloved Taylor, Sheffield merges reportage and criticism in a way that only he can.At once one of the most beloved music figures of the past two decades and one of the most criticized, Taylor Swift is known as much for her life beyond her music as she is for her constant stream of hits?and most of all, how she uses the former to not only create the latter, but market and brand herself throughout the many ?eras? of her career. At once both approachable and enigmatic, Taylor Swift has become a master </p>

<p>Summary : One hundred years. Tens of thousands of gladiators. And today, only one will rise?Everything in the Kingdom of Arrow is a lie.Leith of Grey thought coming to this new land and volunteering to fight in the gladiator arena?vicious, bloodthirsty tournaments where only the strongest survive?would earn him enough gold to save his dying sister. He thought there was nothing left to lose.He was wrong?and they took everything. His hope. His freedom. His very humanity.All Leith has left is his battle-scarred body, fueled by rage and hardened from years of fighting for the right to live another day.Then Leith meets Maeve, an elven royal who is everything he despises. Everything he should hate. Until the alluring princess offers him the one thing he needs most: a chance to win the coveted title of Bloodguard?and his freedom.But in a kingdom built on secrets and lies, hope doesn?t come cheap.Nor will his ultimate revenge?</p>

<p>Summary : Onze li??es breves para entender as origens do racismo e como combat?-lo.Neste pequeno manual, a fil?sofa e ativista Djamila Ribeiro trata de temas como atualidade do racismo, negritude, branquitude, viol?ncia racial, cultura, desejos e afetos. Em onze cap?tulos curtos e contundentes, a autora apresenta caminhos de reflex?o para aqueles que queiram aprofundar sua percep??o sobre discrimina??es racistas estruturais e assumir a responsabilidade pela transforma??o do estado das coisas. J? h? muitos anos se solidifica a percep??o de que o racismo est? arraigado em nossa sociedade, criando desigualdades e abismos sociais: trata-se de um sistema de opress?o que nega direitos, e n?o um simples ato de vontade de um sujeito. Reconhecer as ra?zes e o impacto do racismo pode ser paralisante. Afinal, como enfrentar um monstro desse tamanho? Djamila Ribeiro argumenta que a pr?tica antirracista ? urgente e se d? nas atitudes mais cotidianas. E mais ainda: ? uma luta de todas e todos.</p>

Em onze cap?tulos curtos e contundentes, a autora apresenta caminhos de reflex?o para aqueles que queiram aprofundar sua percep??o sobre discrimina??es racistas estruturais e assumir a responsabilidade pela transforma??o do estado das coisas. J? h? muitos anos se solidifica a percep??o de que o racismo est? arraigado em nossa sociedade, criando desigualdades e abismos sociais: trata-se de um sistema de opress?o que nega direitos, e n?o um simples ato de vontade de um sujeito. Reconhecer as ra?zes e o impacto do racismo pode ser paralisante. Afinal, como enfrentar um monstro desse tamanho? Djamila Ribeiro argumenta que a pr?tica antirracista ? urgente e se d? nas atitudes mais cotidianas. E mais ainda: ? uma luta de todas e todos.</p>

<p>Summary : Fin da bambini ci raccontano che se sbagli prendi un brutto voto; se sbagli non vieni promosso e non fai carriera, in certi casi addirittura perdi il lavoro; se sbagli perdi la stima degli altri e anche la tua. Sbagliare ? violare le regole, sbagliare ? fallire. Per l?ignoranza, se possibile, i contorni sono ancora pi? netti: l?ignoranza relega alla marginalit?. E quando si passa dalla definizione della condizione (ignoranza) all?espressione che indica il soggetto in quella condizione (ignorante), il lessico acquista il connotato dell?offesa. In realt?, l?errore ? una parte inevitabile dei processi di apprendimento e di crescita, e ammetterlo ? un passaggio fondamentale per lo sviluppo di menti aperte e personalit? equilibrate. Cos? come osservare con simpatia la nostra sconfinata, enciclopedica ignoranza ? spesso la premessa per non smettere di stupirsi e di gioire per le meraviglie della scienza, dell?arte, della natura.</p>

<p>Summary : Basta un a?o de meditaci?n perseverante, o incluso medio, para percatarse de que se puede vivir de otra forma. La meditaci?n agrieta la estructura de nuestra personalidad hasta que, de tanto meditar, la grieta se ensancha y la vieja personalidad se rompe y, como una flor, comienza a nacer una nueva. Meditar es asistir a este fascinante y tremendo proceso de muerte y renacimiento. Poco m?s de un centenar de p?ginas de inaudita intensidad que nos ayudan a comprender la importancia de esa humilde pero profunda virtud que es la atenci?n. Un libro tan peque?o como exquisito que recoge una obstinada b?squeda de s? mismo. Tras conocer a Franz Jalics -su maestro- y en respuesta a los miles de lectores que le escribieron para comentarle y agradecerle su Biograf?a del silencio, Pablo d&#8217;Ors funda en 2014 la asociaci?n Amigos del Desierto, cuyo prop?sito es profundizar y promover la pr?ctica contemplativa.</p>

<p>Summary : We live in an age of unprecedented anxiety. Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not?and cannot?know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing. In The Wisdom of Insecurity, he shows us how, in order to lead a fulfilling life, we must embrace the present?and live fully in the now.</p>

<p>Summary : From the National Magazine Award-winning Runner?s World columnist, frequent New Yorker online contributor, and Cambridge-trained physicist: a fascinating and definitive exploration of the extraordinary science of human endurance and the secrets of human performance, for fans of The Sports Gene, Born to Run, and Grit.From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we?re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person?s limits?For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation.

<p>Summary : Da quando Haven ha incontrato la pazza famiglia Lively, la sua vita ? cambiata. Dopo avervi rinunciato all&#8217;incontro con Hades e ai soldi, la ragazza ha un&#8217;ultima opportunit? per saldare i debiti del padre: cedere ai giochi dei Titani Crono e Rea, sull&#8217;Olimpo. Entrare nel Labirinto del Minotauro potrebbe essere infatti l&#8217;occasione per chiudere ogni conto in sospeso. Nessuno pu? rivelarle cosa si nasconde dentro quel luogo misterioso, ma Haven ? determinata a vincere. Come Teseo sconfisse il Minotauro alleandosi con Arianna, per?, anche lei deve capire di chi fidarsi. L&#8217;altra parte della famiglia, che conosce gli orrori di cui Crono ? capace, vuole aiutarla. Ma mentre trapelano nuovi segreti e antiche figure del passato tornano a perseguitarla, il filo rosso che rappresenta la sua unica via d&#8217;uscita si rivela essere pi? fragile di quanto sperasse. I suoi ricordi sono stati manipolati, e la verit? ? nascosta dalle bugie che il Titano ha abilmente costruito fin da quando lei era piccola. </p>

<p>Summary : An award-winning scholar uncovers the guiding principles of Lincoln&#8217;s antislavery strategies. Lincoln adopted the antislavery view that the Constitution made freedom the rule in the United States, slavery the exception. Where federal power prevailed, so did freedom. Where state power prevailed, that state determined the status of slavery, and the federal government could not interfere. It would take state action to achieve the final abolition of American slavery. With this understanding, Lincoln and his antislavery allies used every tool available to undermine the institution. Wherever the Constitution empowered direct federal action, they intervened. As a congressman in 1849 Lincoln sponsored a bill to abolish slavery in Washington, DC. He reentered politics in 1854 to oppose what he considered the unconstitutional opening of the territories to slavery by the Kansas-Nebraska Act. President Lincoln took full advantage of the antislavery options opened by the Civil War. The </p>

<p>Summary : Teagan Firestone has always been the dutiful daughter, especially since her mom died. But as her father finally begins to move on, it?s her turn to do the same. Her destination: Pearl Lake, a close-knit community with an entrepreneurial spirit and secrets of its own.One of them is Aaron Saunders, who dropped out of college to work construction for Pearl Lake?s upper class. He?s a mystery and has a playboy reputation?that is, until he meets Teagan. Neither of them is looking for love, but in a town this small, it?s hard not to let your heart get involved. As their romance heats up, Aaron?s elusive past comes to light and Teagan is there for him, bringing them even closer together. But when Teagan is forced to face her own demons, her inability to accept the support of friends and family threatens the life she?s worked so hard to build. Can Aaron love her, even when she can?t love herself?</p>

<p>Summary : Thirty-two New Takes on Taiwan Cinema covers thirty-two films from Taiwan, addressing a flowering of new talent, moving from art film to genre pictures, and nonfiction. Beyond the conventional framework of privileging ?New and Post-New Cinema,? or prominence of auteurs or single films, this volume is a comprehensive, judicious take on Taiwan cinema that fills gaps in the literature, offers a renewed historiography, and introduces new creative force and voices of Taiwan?s moving image culture to produce a leading and accessible work on Taiwan film and culture. Film-by-film is conceived as the main carrier of moving picture imagery for a majority of viewers, across the world. The curation offers an array of formal, historical, genre, sexual, social, and political frames, which provide a rich brew of contexts. This surfeit of meanings is carried by individual films, one by one, which breaks down abstractions into narrative bites and outsized emotions.</p>

<p>Summary : The day Christopher saved a drowning baby griffin from a hidden lake would change his life forever. It&#8217;s the day he learned about the Archipelago, a cluster of unmapped islands where magical creatures of every kind have thrived for thousands of years?until now. And it&#8217;s the day he met Mal, a girl on the run who desperately needs his help. Mal and Christopher embark on a wild adventure, racing from island to island, searching for someone who can explain why the magic is fading and why magical creatures are suddenly dying. They consult sphinxes, battle kraken, and negotiate with dragons. But the closer they get to the dark truth of what&#8217;s happening, the clearer it becomes: no one else can fix this. If the Archipelago is to be saved, Mal and Christopher will have to do it themselves.</p>

<p>Summary : It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.The odds are against him. He&#8217;s been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined &#8212; every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute&#8230; and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.</p>

  He was seventeen when an all-white jury sentenced him to prison for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit. Now, in this unforgettable memoir, a pioneering lawyer recalls the journey that led to his exoneration&#8211;and inspired him to devote his life to fighting the many injustices in our legal system. <br />

In prison, Adams was sustained by his mother and aunts, who brought him back from the edge of despair through letters of prayers and encouragement. After studying the law and realizing how his Constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel had been violated, he solicited a relationship with the Wisconsin Innocence Project, an organization that exonerates the wrongfully convicted, which ultimately led to his release from prison after nearly ten years.But the journey was far from over.

She came face to face with the Delvers, and finally got answers to the questions she?s had about her own strange Cytonic gifts.

<p>Summary : &#8220;One of the best books short of the famous Ann Rule works.&#8221; &#8211;True Crime Book ReviewsOn a snowy winter evening in 1982, twenty-one-year-old Mary Brown accepted a ride from a handsome stranger in the resort town of Breckenridge, Colorado. The trip ended with her brutally beaten and raped. Mary survived, but her predator&#8217;s violence had only just begun. After ten years in prison, Tom Luther was released a far more vicious criminal. Soon, from the Rockies to West Virginia, like Ted Bundy, Luther enticed a chain of women into his murderous trap. In this gripping new edition of a true crime masterpiece, acclaimed author Steve Jackson recounts the intriguing pursuit and long awaited conviction of a charismatic, monstrous psychopath&#8211;one who remains a suspect in three other crimes, and has never given up hope of escape. &#8220;Steve Jackson is a born storyteller. He makes you sweat. . .and turn the page.&#8221; &#8211;Ron Franscell, author of The Darkest NightIncludes 16 Pages Of Dramatic Photos</p>

<p>Summary : From an exciting and sharp-voiced new observer of American culture, a forthright and probing debut exploring Asian American identity in a racially codified country After his father?s passing in 2019, David Shih sought to unravel the underlying tensions that defined the complex relationship between him and his parents?a question that ultimately forced a reckoning with the expectations he encountered as the only son of Chinese immigrants and the realities of what it means to be Asian in a segregated country. Chinese Prodigal is a candid examination of a society and the people it has never made space for.In public life and in Shih?s own, ?Asian Americanness? has changed shape constantly, directed by the needs of the country?s racial imaginary. A sliding scale, visibility for Asians in America has always been relative, something that only comes into focus when it aligns with broader political agendas.

<p>Summary : Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn&#8217;t thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she&#8217;d claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie?magical, comforting, wise beyond her years?promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from </p>

<p>Summary : One of the best-loved of Nabokov?s novels, Pnin features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian ?migr? precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950s. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunderstandings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader?s deepest protective instinct.Serialized in The New Yorker and published in book form in 1957, Pnin brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented </p>

<p>Summary : In a world that?s grown increasingly confused about&#8211;and hostile toward&#8211;the very notion of masculinity, authors Jefferson Bethke and Jon Tyson send a powerful call to men it&#8217;s time to step into the light of Jesus&#8217; vision for you as a man. There&#8217;s a shadow that&#8217;s settled over the hearts of men today. Masculinity is in crisis. Critiques about the dangers of toxic masculinity and the abuses of patriarchal systems have grown louder than ever. The very notions of masculinity and manhood are under attack. In response to cultural shifts, some have doubled down on old stereotypes in ways that just add to the conflict and confusion. The result? Many men simply feel paralyzed&#8211;worried about saying the wrong thing, unsure what to do with their ambitions or strengths, simultaneously tempted and shamed by a hypersexualized and pornified culture. Our models and mentors have failed us. Based on their years of working in men&#8217;s ministry, Bethke and Tyson have good news for men looking for clarity </p>

<p>Summary : One of the most influential works of this century, The Myth of Sisyphus?featured here in a stand-alone edition?is a crucial exposition of existentialist thought. Influenced by works such as Don Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide&#8211;the question of living or not living in a universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Albert Camus brilliantly posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  The remarkable true story of a modern-day Robin Hood: a British college student who started robbing banks as the financial crisis unfolded. <br />
When the signs of an impending global financial crisis became clear in 2007, socially isolated British college student Stephen Jackley decided to take a stand by becoming a bank robber, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.

<p>Summary : This revealing biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt shows how one of the most consequential leaders in American history found his true self in his searing struggle with polio&#8211;emerging from illness with a strength and wisdom he would use to inspire the world.In popular memory, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the quintessential political ?natural.? Born in 1882 to a wealthy, influential family and blessed with an abundance of charm and charisma, he seemed destined for high office. Yet for all his gifts, the young Roosevelt nonetheless lacked depth, empathy, and an ability to think strategically. Those qualities, so essential to his success as president, were skills he acquired during his seven-year journey through illness and recovery. Becoming FDR traces the riveting story of the struggle that forged Roosevelt?s character and political ascent. Soon after contracting polio in 1921 at the age of thirty-nine, the former failed vice-presidential candidate was left paralyzed from the waist </p>
