<p>Summary : The stakes are higher. The witches are deadlier. And the romance is red-hot. The eagerly anticipated sequel to the New York Times and Indiebound bestseller Serpent &amp; Dove is perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and is an instant New York Times bestseller!Lou, Reid, Coco, and Ansel are on the run from coven, kingdom, and church?fugitives with nowhere to hide.To survive, they need allies. Strong ones. But as Lou becomes increasingly desperate to save those she loves, she turns to a darker side of magic that may cost Reid the one thing he can?t bear to lose. Bound to her always, his vows were clear: where Lou goes, he will go; and where she stays, he will stay.Until death do they part.?</p>

<p>Summary : Louisiana, 1904 Te Trois, Eddie, Tit e Julie non potrebbero essere pi? diversi, e neppure pi? amici. In comune hanno un catalogo di vendita per corrispondenza, tre dollari da spendere e una gran voglia di scoprire il mondo. E quando, anzich? la rivoltella che hanno ordinato, arriva un vecchio orologio che nemmeno funziona, i quattro non ci pensano due volte e partono verso Chicago, per farselo cambiare. Fra un treno merci e un battello a vapore sul Mississippi, si troveranno alle prese con un cadavere nelle sabbie mobili, imbroglioni e bari di professione, poliziotti corrotti, cattivi che sembrano buoni e buoni che non lo sono affatto&#8230; per non parlare di un delitto irrisolto e di molti, molti soldi! Un&#8217;avventura con quattro protagonisti che avrebbero potuto essere i migliori amici di Tom Sawyer.</p>

<p>Summary : Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it.For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn?t you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man?s life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final ?class?: lessons in how to live.Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle </p>

<p>Summary : In the aftermath of a series of student riots in Seoul, the U.S. Congress rushes a bill into law calling for the complete withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. This sets off a chain reaction: North Korea attacks across the DMZ, Russia supports North Korea, the Chinese remain neutral, and the United States fights again alongside its South Korean allies. The full range of ground, air, and naval forces take part in vicious combat, first to hold off the North Korean onslaught, then drive them back.</p>

<p>Summary : In No Brainer, book 18 of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series from #1 international bestselling author Jeff Kinney, it&#8217;s up to Greg to save his crumbling school before it&#8217;s shuttered for good. Up until now, middle school hasn&#8217;t exactly been a joyride for Greg Heffley. So when the town threatens to close the crumbling building, he&#8217;s not too broken up about it. But when Greg realizes this means he&#8217;s going to be sent to a different school than his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, he changes his tune. Can Greg and his classmates save their school before it&#8217;s shuttered for good? Or is this the start of a whole new chapter for Greg?</p>

<p>Summary : Wenn irgendwann einmal ein Preis f?r den besten Buchtitel vergeben werden sollte, w?rde f?r mich Thomas Manns Zauberberg ganz oben auf die Liste geh?ren. Noch bevor ich das Buch gelesen hatte, weckte schon das Wort Neugier auf eine magische Welt. Nun, wer den Zauberberg kennt, wei?, da? dies kein Buch von fremden Feenwelten ist, und doch waltet hier eindeutig Magie. Die erste magische Leistung besteht darin, eine Handlung, die in einem Satz zusammengefa?t werden kann, auf 1.000 Seiten zu packen: Der junge Hamburger Hans Castorp, Spro? einer Patrizierfamilie lebt bis zum Ausbruch des ersten Weltkriegs sieben Jahre in einem Schweizer Luxussanatorium f?r Lungenkranke, ohne selbst krank zu sein. Die zweite magische Leistung ist Thomas Manns Sprache, die auch in tausend Jahren nichts von ihrer Kraft verloren haben wird. Die dritte magische Leistung ist die Behandlung der Figuren, die alle mehr mehr sind als blo?e Protagonisten. Sie sind Exponate ihrer Zeit, jede f?r sich repr?sentiert </p>

<p>Summary : In her #1 NYT bestsellers, Bren? Brown taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers and culture shifters, she?s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.When we dare to lead, we don&#8217;t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don&#8217;t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don&#8217;t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that?s necessary to do good work.But daring leadership in a culture that&#8217;s </p>

<p>Summary : Now a Netflix film starring and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, this is a gripping memoir of survival and perseverance about the heroic young inventor who brought electricity to his Malawian village.When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba&#8217;s tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season&#8217;s crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family&#8217;s life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William&#8217;s windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land.Retold for a younger audience, this exciting memoir shows how, even in a desperate situation, one boy&#8217;s brilliant idea can light up the world. Complete with photographs, illustrations, and an epilogue that will bring readers up to date on William&#8217;s story, this is the </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;My name is Gary. I?m a thirty-year-old legal assistant with a firm of solicitors in London. To describe me as anonymous would be unfair but to notice me other than in passing would be a rarity. I did make a good connection with a girl, but that blew up in my face and smacked my arse with a fish slice.&#8217;Gary Thorn goes for a pint with a work acquaintance called Brendan.

<p>Summary : Christopher Boone ha quindici anni e soffre della sindrome di Asperger, una forma di autismo. Il suo rapporto con il mondo ? problematico: odia essere toccato, detesta il giallo e il marrone, si arrabbia se i mobili di casa vengono spostati, non riesce a interpretare l&#8217;espressione del viso delle persone, non sorride mai&#8230; In compenso, adora la matematica, l&#8217;astronomia e i romanzi gialli, ed ? intenzionato a scriverne uno. S?, perch? da quando ha scoperto il cadavere di Wellington, il cane della vicina, non riesce a darsi pace. E gettandosi nel ?caso? con la stessa passione del suo eroe Sherlock Holmes, finisce per portare alla luce un mistero pi? profondo, che gli cambier? la vita e lo costringer? ad addentrarsi nel mondo caotico e rumoroso degli altri. Primo libro di Mark Haddon destinato agli adulti, Lo strano caso del cane ucciso a mezzanotte ? una detective story avvincente e tenerissima, che ha fatto incetta di premi e conquistato milioni di lettori in tutto il mondo.</p>

<p>Summary : Ceux que nous aimons sont parfois ceux qui nous font le plus mal. Lily Blossom Bloom n&#8217;a pas eu une enfance tr?s facile, entre un p?re violent et une m?re qu&#8217;elle trouve soumise, mais elle a su s&#8217;en sortir dans la vie et est ? l&#8217;aube de r?aliser le r?ve de sa vie : ouvrir, ? Boston, une boutique de fleurs. Elle vient de rencontrer un neurochirurgien, Lyle, charmant, ambitieux, visiblement aussi attir? par elle qu&#8217;elle l&#8217;est par lui. Le chemin de Lily semble tout trac?. Elle h?site pourtant encore un peu : il n&#8217;est pas facile pour elle de se lancer dans une histoire sentimentale, avec des parents comme les siens et Atlas, ce jeune homme qu&#8217;elle avait rencontr? adolescente, lui a laiss? des souvenirs ? la fois merveilleux et douloureux. Est-ce que le chemin de Lily est finalement aussi simple ? Les choix les plus ?vidents sont-ils les meilleurs ?</p>

<p>Summary : The Best Simple Recipes?offers more than 200 full-flavored easy-to-prepare recipes that can be on the table in 30 minutes or less in an easy-to-read paperback format.  Just because time is short, it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to settle for a can of soup or a sandwich for dinner, or making one of the many boring and flavorless fast recipes (which often aren&#8217;t even as fast as they promise). Our test cooks have created more than 200 recipes that keep the ingredients and cooking time to a minimum and offer tons of flavor and plenty of variety.  By combining steps, minimizing pans, and employing a little test kitchen trickery, our test cooks have made naturally fast recipes even faster, and they&#8217;ve made recipes that traditionally take hours ready for the table in half an hour. And while they used a minimum of ingredients, one thing they didn&#8217;t minimize was flavor.</p>

<p>Summary : Hi! I?m Seth! I was asked to describe my book, Yearbook, for the inside flap (which is a gross phrase) and for websites and shit like that, so? here it goes!!! Yearbook is a collection of true stories that I desperately hope are just funny at worst, and life-changingly amazing at best. (I understand that it?s likely the former, which is a fancy ?book? way of saying ?the first one.?)  I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like. I also talk about some of my adventures in Los Angeles, and surely say things about other famous people that will create a wildly awkward conversation for me at a party one day. I hope you enjoy the book should you buy it, and if you don?t enjoy it, I?m sorry. If you ever see me on the street and explain the situation, I?ll do my best to make it up to you.</p>

<p>Summary : Combining the soul-baring confessional of Brain on Fire and the addictive storytelling of The Queen?s Gambit , a renowned puzzle creator?s compulsively readable memoir and history of the crossword puzzle as an unexpected site of women?s work and feminist protest. The indisputable ?queen of crosswords,? Anna Shechtman published her first New York Times puzzle at age nineteen, and later, spearheaded the The New Yorker ?s popular crossword section.

As she tells the story of her own experience in the CrossWorld, she </p>

<p>Summary : The Battle of Arnhem is one of the best-known stories in British military history: a daring but thwarted attempt to secure a vital bridgehead across the Rhine in order to end the war before Christmas. It is always written about, with the benefit of unerring 20/20 hindsight, as being doomed to fail, but the men who fought there, men of military legend, didn&#8217;t know that that was to be their fate.By focusing on the events of one day as they happened through the eyes of the British participants and without bringing any knowledge of what would happen tomorrow to bear, Al Murray offers a very different perspective to a familiar narrative. Some things went right and a great many more went wrong, but recounting them in this way allows the reader to understand for the first time how certain decisions were taken in the moment and how opportunities were squandered.Tuesday 19 September 1944 was that terrible day which became known as Black Tuesday.

<p>Summary : Un padre e un figlio, dentro una stanza. L?uno di fronte all?altro, come mai sono stati. Ciascuno lo specchio dell?altro. Loro due, insieme, in un reparto di neuropsichiatria infantile. Ci sono altri genitori, in quel reparto, altri figli. Adolescenti che rifiutano il cibo o che si fanno del male, che vivono l?estenuante fatica di crescere, dentro famiglie incapaci di dare un nome al loro tormento. E madri e padri spaesati, che condividono la stessa ferita, l?intollerabile sensazione di non essere pi? all?altezza del proprio compito. Con la voce calda, intima, di un padre smarrito, Matteo Bussola fotografa l?istante spaventoso in cui genitori e figli smettono di riconoscersi, e parlarsi diventa impossibile. Attraverso un pugno di personaggi strazianti e bellissimi, ci ricorda che ogni essere umano ? un mistero, anche quando siamo noi ad averlo generato.</p>

<p>Summary : Nothing warms a cold heart like true love, and in this newest Black Dagger Brotherhood winter book, a fighter who has never been a savior finds himself falling in love?and trying to rescue?a male who?s lost all hope. With the BDB training center reopening, and the Brothers looking to add more soldiers in the war against the Lessening Society, fan favorite Callum decides to find his purpose in fighting. Apex knows what suffering the male has survived, and he joins the program just to make sure Callum doesn?t get himself killed. As the two hit the streets, and the danger gets real, Callum must decide whether he can open himself up to love or if he will give in to his inner darkness and spiral down into an abyss of hatred and death&#8230; forever.</p>

<p>Summary : An enthralling journey through the history of books and libraries in the ancient world and those who have helped preserve their rich literary traditionsLong before books were mass-produced, those made of reeds from along the Nile were worth fighting and dying for. Journeying along the battlefields of Alexander the Great, beneath the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius, at Cleopatra&#8217;s palaces and the scene of Hypatia&#8217;s murder, award-winning author Irene Vallejo chronicles the excitement of literary culture in the ancient world, and the heroic efforts that ensured this extraordinary tradition would continue. Weaved throughout are fascinating stories about the spies, scribes, illuminators, librarians, booksellers, authors, and statesmen whose rich and sometimes complicated engagement with the written word bears remarkable similarities to the world today: Aristophanes and the censorship of the humorists, Sappho and the empowerment of women&#8217;s voices, Seneca and the problem of a post-truth world. </p>

<p>Summary : An enthralling journey through the history of books and libraries in the ancient world and those who have helped preserve their rich literary traditionsLong before books were mass-produced, those made of reeds from along the Nile were worth fighting and dying for. Journeying along the battlefields of Alexander the Great, beneath the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius, at Cleopatra&#8217;s palaces and the scene of Hypatia&#8217;s murder, award-winning author Irene Vallejo chronicles the excitement of literary culture in the ancient world, and the heroic efforts that ensured this extraordinary tradition would continue. Weaved throughout are fascinating stories about the spies, scribes, illuminators, librarians, booksellers, authors, and statesmen whose rich and sometimes complicated engagement with the written word bears remarkable similarities to the world today: Aristophanes and the censorship of the humorists, Sappho and the empowerment of women&#8217;s voices, Seneca and the problem of a post-truth world. </p>

<p>Summary : When Dr. Michaeleen Doucleff becomes a mother, she examines the studies behind modern parenting guidance and finds the evidence frustratingly limited and the conclusions often ineffective. Curious to learn about more effective parenting approaches, she visits a Maya village in the Yucat?n Peninsula. There she encounters moms and dads who parent in a totally different way than we do?and raise extraordinarily kind, generous, and helpful children without yelling, nagging, or issuing timeouts. What else, Doucleff wonders, are Western parents missing out on? In Hunt, Gather, Parent, Doucleff sets out with her three-year-old daughter in tow to learn and practice parenting strategies from families in three of the world?s most venerable communities: Maya families in Mexico, Inuit families above the Arctic Circle, and Hadzabe families in Tanzania. She sees that these cultures don?t have the same problems with children that Western parents do. Most strikingly, parents build a relationship with </p>

<p>Summary : Since his execution by guillotine in July 1794, Maximilien Robespierre has been contested terrain for historians. Was he a bloodthirsty charlatan or the only true defender of revolutionary ideals? The first modern dictator or the earliest democrat? Was his extreme moralism a heroic virtue or a ruinous flaw? Against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution, historian Ruth Scurr tracks Robespierre&#8217;s evolution from provincial lawyer to devastatingly efficient revolutionary leader, righteous and paranoid in equal measure. She explores his reformist zeal, his role in the fall of the monarchy, his passionate attempts to design a modern republic, even his extraordinary effort to found a perfect religion. And she follows him into the Terror, as the former death- penalty opponent makes summary execution the order of the day, himself falling victim to the violence at the age of thirty-six. Written with epic sweep, full of nuance and insight, Fatal Purity is a fascinating portrait of a </p>

<p>Summary : The powerful and moving memoir of a fearless political opposition leader who paid the ultimate price for his beliefs.Alexei Navalny began writing Patriot shortly after his near-fatal poisoning in 2020. It is the full story of his life: his youth, his call to activism, his marriage and family, his commitment to challenging a world super-power determined to silence him, and his total conviction that change cannot be resisted?and will come.  In vivid, page-turning detail, including never-before-seen correspondence from prison, Navalny recounts, among other things, his political career, the many attempts on his life, and the lives of the people closest to him, and the relentless campaign he and his team waged against an increasingly dictatorial regime.  Written with the passion, wit, candor, and bravery for which he was justly acclaimed, Patriot is Navalny?s final letter to the world: a moving account of his last years spent in the most brutal prison on earth; a reminder of why the </p>

<p>Summary : Janet Evanovich, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum series, teams up with Emmy-winning writer Phoef Sutton for a brand-new series of thrillers featuring the invincible and incompatible pairing of Knight and Moon.  Emerson Knight is introverted, eccentric, and has little to no sense of social etiquette. Good thing he?s also brilliant, rich, and (some people might say) handsome, or he?d probably be homeless. Riley Moon has just graduated from Harvard Business and Harvard Law. Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude has helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst with mega-bank Blane-Grunwald. At least Riley Moon thought it was her dream job, until she is given her first assignment: babysitting Emerson Knight.

<p>Summary : Janet Evanovich, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum series, teams up with Emmy-winning writer Phoef Sutton for a brand-new series of thrillers featuring the invincible and incompatible pairing of Knight and Moon.  Emerson Knight is introverted, eccentric, and has little to no sense of social etiquette. Good thing he?s also brilliant, rich, and (some people might say) handsome, or he?d probably be homeless. Riley Moon has just graduated from Harvard Business and Harvard Law. Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude has helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst with mega-bank Blane-Grunwald. At least Riley Moon thought it was her dream job, until she is given her first assignment: babysitting Emerson Knight.  What starts off as an inquiry about missing bank funds in the Knight account leads to inquiries about a missing man, missing gold, and a life-and-death race across the country. Through the streets of Washington, D.C., and down into the underground </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  My story has been told many times and by highly regarded experts in their fields [judges, prosecutors, juvenile probation officers, sociologists, journalists]. But today, if you&#8217;ll bear with me, I would like to try to tell it to you myself. I have reason to believe the experts may be wrong about me. You see, today, thirty years later, I am neither in prison nor dead.&#8211;Ian Manuel <br />
The United States is the only country in the world that sentences thirteen- and fourteen-year-old offenders, mostly youth of color, to life in prison without parole, regardless of the scientifically proven singularities of the developing adolescent brain&#8211;a heinous wrinkle in the scandal of mass incarceration. In 1991, Ian Manuel, then fourteen was sentenced to life without parole for a non-homicide crime. In a botched mugging attempt with some older boys, he shot Debbie Baigrie, a young white mother of two, in the face. But as Bryan Stevenson has insisted, none of us should be judged by only the worst </p>

<p>Summary : Ocean?s Echo is a stand-alone, romantic space adventure, set in the same universe as Everina Maxwell&#8217;s hit debut, Winter&#8217;s Orbit.When Tennal?a rich socialite, inveterate flirt, and walking disaster?is caught using his telepathic powers for illegal activities, the military decides to bind his mind to someone with coercive powers strong enough to control him.Enter Lieutenant Surit, the child of a disgraced general. Out of a desperate need to restore a pension to his other parent, Lieutenant Surit agrees to be bound to Tennal and keep him conscripted in the army, a task that seems impossible even for someone with Surit&#8217;s ability to control minds.Tennal just wants to escape, but Surit isn?t all that he seems. And their bond may just be the key to their freedom.</p>

<p>Summary : Lieber jetzt als nie!Ab sofort gibt es keine Ausreden mehr, den Verm?gensaufbau aufzuschieben. Denn nie war es so einfach wie heute, sein Geld gewinnbringend anzulegen.

<p>Summary : In this rapturous memoir, writer and activist Laura Coleman shares the story of her liberating journey in the Amazon jungle, where she fell in love with a magnificent cat who changed her life.Laura was in her early twenties and directionless when she quit her job to backpack in Bolivia. Fate landed her at a wildlife sanctuary on the edge of the Amazon jungle where she was assigned to a beautiful and complex puma named Wayra. Wide-eyed, inexperienced, and comically terrified, Laura made the scrappy, make-do camp her home. And in Wayra, she made a friend for life.They weren?t alone, not with over a hundred quirky animals to care for, each lost and hurt in their own way: a pair of suicidal, bra-stealing monkeys, a frustrated parrot desperate to fly, and a pig with a wicked sense of humor. The humans too were cause for laughter and tears. There were animal whisperers, committed staff, wildly devoted volunteers, handsome heartbreakers, and a machete-wielding prom queen who carried Laura </p>

<p>Summary : Newly single lawyer Gwen Baker is hoping that a family Christmas?countryside, a mountain of food and festive films?will salve the sting of her career hanging by a thread and her heart being trampled on.

She can?t help wishing her future was clearer.Then Gwen wakes up to discover it?s Christmas day all over again. Like Groundhog Day but with eggnog. And family arguments. On repeat.As she figures out how to escape her own particular Christmas hell, Dev is the one bright spot. He might be all grown-up but underneath he?s just as kind and funny as she remembers.Maybe, just maybe, her heart can be mended after all.But how do you fall in love with someone who can?t remember you from one day to the next?</p>
