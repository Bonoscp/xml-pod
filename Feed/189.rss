<p>Summary : A groundbreaking new history of the role of American servicewomen in WWII, illuminating their forgotten yet essential contributions to the Allies&#8217; victory. Valiant Women is the story of the 350,000 American women who served in uniform during World War II. These incredible women served in every service branch, in every combat theater, and in nearly two-thirds of the available military occupations at the time. They were pilots, codebreakers, ordnance experts, gunnery instructors, metalsmiths, chemists, translators, parachute riggers, truck drivers, radarmen, pigeon trainers, and much more. They were directly involved in some of the most important moments of the war, from the D-Day landings to the peace negotiations in Paris. These women&#8211;who hailed from every race, creed, and walk of life&#8211;died for their country and received the nation&#8217;s highest honors. Their work, both individually and in total, was at the heart of the Allied strategy that won World War II. Yet, until now, their </p>

Its occupant, Barbara Van Laar, has gone missing. Barbara isn?t just any thirteen-year-old: she?s the daughter of the family that owns the summer camp and employs most of the region?s residents. And this isn?t the first time a Van Laar child has disappeared. Barbara?s older brother similarly vanished fourteen years ago, never to be found.As a panicked search begins, a thrilling drama unfolds.

<p>Summary : Can you keep a secret??I grew up sick.??Let me clarify.??I grew up believing that real love stories include a martyr or demand great sacrifice to be worthy.?? Because of that, I believed it, because I made myself believe it, and I bred the most masochistic of romantic hearts, which resulted in my illness.??When I lived this story, my own twisted fairy tale, it was unbeknownst to me at the time because I was young and na?ve. I gave into temptation and fed the beating beast, which grew thirstier with every slash, every strike, every blow.?? Triple Falls wasn?t at all what it seemed, nor were the men that swept me under their wing. But in order to keep them, I had to be in on their secrets.?? Secrets that cost us everything to keep.??That?s the novelty of fiction versus reality. You can?t re-live your own love story, because by the time you?ve realized you?re living it, it?s over. At least that was the case for me and the men I trusted my foolish heart to.?? Looking back, I?m convinced </p>

<p>Summary : Can you keep a secret??I grew up sick.??Let me clarify.??I grew up believing that real love stories include a martyr or demand great sacrifice to be worthy.?? Because of that, I believed it, because I made myself believe it, and I bred the most masochistic of romantic hearts, which resulted in my illness.??When I lived this story, my own twisted fairy tale, it was unbeknownst to me at the time because I was young and na?ve. I gave into temptation and fed the beating beast, which grew thirstier with every slash, every strike, every blow.?? Triple Falls wasn?t at all what it seemed, nor were the men that swept me under their wing. But in order to keep them, I had to be in on their secrets.?? Secrets that cost us everything to keep.??That?s the novelty of fiction versus reality. You can?t re-live your own love story, because by the time you?ve realized you?re living it, it?s over. At least that was the case for me and the men I trusted my foolish heart to.?? Looking back, I?m convinced </p>

<p>Summary : An acclaimed writer goes searching for the truth about her wildly unconventional Southern family?and finds that our obsession with ancestors opens up new ways of seeing ourselves.Maud Newton?s ancestors have vexed and fascinated her since she was a girl. Her mother?s father, who came of age in Texas during the Great Depression, was said to have married thirteen times and been shot by one of his wives. Her mother?s grandfather killed a man with a hay hook and died in a mental institution. Mental illness and religious fanaticism percolated through Maud?s maternal lines, to an ancestor accused of being a witch in Puritan-era Massachusetts. Maud?s father, an aerospace engineer turned lawyer, was a book-smart man who extolled the virtues of slavery and obsessed over the ?purity? of his family bloodline, which he traced back to the Revolutionary War. He tried in vain to control Maud?s mother, a whirlwind of charisma and passion given to feverish projects: thirty rescue cats, and a church </p>

 bestselling business journalist Christopher Leonard infiltrates one of America?s most mysterious institutions?the Federal Reserve?to show how its policies over the past ten years have accelerated income inequality and put our country?s economic stability at risk.If you asked most people what forces led to today?s unprecedented income inequality and financial crashes, no one would say the Federal Reserve.

But the Fed also has a unique power to reshape the American economy for the worse, which it did, fatefully, on November 4, 2010 through a radical intervention called quantitative easing.

<p>Summary : An Audie Award Winner David Sedaris, the ?champion storyteller,? (Los Angeles Times) returns with his first new collection of personal essays since the bestselling Calypso. Back when restaurant menus were still printed on paper, and wearing a mask?or not?was a decision made mostly on Halloween, David Sedaris spent his time doing normal things.

<p>Summary : Set in a not-too-distant America, I Cheerfully Refuse is the tale of Rainy, an aspiring musician setting sail on Lake Superior in search of his departed, deeply beloved, bookselling wife. An endearing bear of an Orphean narrator, he seeks refuge in the harbors, fogs, and remote islands of the inland sea. After encountering lunatic storms and rising corpses from the warming depths, he eventually lands to find an increasingly desperate and illiterate people, a malignant billionaire ruling class, a crumbled infrastructure, and a lawless society. As his guileless nature begins to make an inadvertent rebel of him, Rainy?s private quest for the love of his life grows into something wider and wilder, sweeping up friends and foes alike in his wake.</p>

<p>Summary : So often, it&#8217;s the simplest acts of courage that touch the lives of others. Sudha Murty-through the exceptional work of the Infosys Foundation as well as through her own youth, family life and travels-encounters many such stories . . . and she tells them here in her characteristically clear-eyed, warm-hearted way. She talks candidly about the meaningful impact of her work in the devadasi community, her trials and tribulations as the only female student in her engineering college and the unexpected and inspiring consequences of her father&#8217;s kindness. From the quiet joy of discovering the reach of Indian cinema and the origins of Indian vegetables to the shallowness of judging others based on appearances, these are everyday struggles and victories, large and small.Unmasking both the beauty and ugliness of human nature, each of the real-life stories in this collection is reflective of a life lived with grace.</p>

<p>Summary : RumorThere are moments in life when you make a decision. Accept who you are. What you have become. This was one of those times?The fairytale I thought I?d found had become a nightmare so quickly after I said, ?I do.? Which was the reason I ran when I had the chance. Not thinking about the consequences. Just knowing I had to get free before it was my life that was taken.I never expected to end up finding a haven. A place where people were willing to help me hide. It was as if I had walked into my own perfect daydream.King?Don?t believe every pretty face you meet, sweets. You should know by now that?s a terrible f&#8212;-g idea.?She was my job. I was to make her feel safe and do whatever I had to in order to make sure she didn?t run. Underneath the abused and broken exterior, there was a fighter. It was in her eyes. I lived for the moments when she let me see that spark.I had been headed straight to Hell years before I met Rumor, but letting her fall in love with me was going to reserve me </p>

<p>Summary : This poetic, genre-bending work?blending memoir with cultural history?from Whiting Award winner Nadia Owusu grapples with the fault lines of identity, the meaning of home, black womanhood, and the ripple effects, both personal and generational, of emotional trauma. Nadia Owusu grew up all over the world?from Rome and London to Dar-es-Salaam and Kampala. When her mother abandoned her when she was two years old, the rejection caused Nadia to be confused about her identity. Even after her father died when she was thirteen and she was raised by her stepmother, she was unable to come to terms with who she was since she still felt motherless and alone. When Nadia went to university in America when she was eighteen she still felt as if she had so many competing personas that she couldn?t keep track of them all without cracking under the pressure of trying to hold herself together. A powerful coming-of-age story that explores timely and universal themes of identity, Aftershocks follows </p>

Stein&#8217;s strong influence on 20th-century literature is evident in this 1915 work of highly original prose rendered in thought-provoking experimental techniques.</p>

  Whatever you&#8217;ve heard about Caraval, it doesn&#8217;t compare to the reality. It&#8217;s more than just a game or a performance. It&#8217;s the closest you&#8217;ll ever find to magic in this world . . . <br />

<p>Summary : For years, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was hailed as a miracle. Study after study showed that HRT, undergone at the onset of menopause, could ease symptoms ranging from hot flashes to memory loss; reduce the risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers; and even extend a woman&#8217;s overall life expectancy. But when a large study by the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative announced results showing an uptick in breast cancer among women taking estrogen replacement, the winds shifted abruptly, and HRT, officially deemed a carcinogen, was abandoned.As it turns out, however, that study was fatally flawed. Now, fifteen years after HRT was left for dead, Dr. Bluming, a clinical oncologist, and Dr. Tavris, a social psychologist and a leading voice at the intersection of gender and medical bias, track its strange history and present a compelling case for its resurrection.They investigate what led the public &#8212; and much of the medical establishment &#8212; to believe in a flawed study.

<p>Summary : For years, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was hailed as a miracle. Study after study showed that HRT, undergone at the onset of menopause, could ease symptoms ranging from hot flashes to memory loss; reduce the risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers; and even extend a woman&#8217;s overall life expectancy. But when a large study by the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative announced results showing an uptick in breast cancer among women taking estrogen replacement, the winds shifted abruptly, and HRT, officially deemed a carcinogen, was abandoned.As it turns out, however, that study was fatally flawed. Now, fifteen years after HRT was left for dead, Dr. Bluming, a clinical oncologist, and Dr. Tavris, a social psychologist and a leading voice at the intersection of gender and medical bias, track its strange history and present a compelling case for its resurrection.They investigate what led the public &#8212; and much of the medical establishment &#8212; to believe in a flawed study.

<p>Summary : From the bestselling author of The Lincoln Highway, A Gentleman in Moscow, and Rules of Civility, a richly detailed and sharply drawn collection of stories set in New York and Los Angeles.The millions of readers of Amor Towles are in for a treat as he shares some of his shorter six stories set in New York City and a novella in Los Angeles. The New York stories, most of which are set around the turn of the millennium, take up everything from the death-defying acrobatics of the male ego, to the fateful consequences of brief encounters, and the delicate mechanics of compromise which operate at the heart of modern marriages.In Towles?s novel, Rules of Civility, the indomitable Evelyn Ross leaves New York City in September, 1938, with the intention of returning home to Indiana. But as her train pulls into Chicago, where her parents are waiting, she instead extends her ticket to Los Angeles.

<p>Summary : Churchill is generally considered one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century, if not the greatest of all, revered for his opposition to appeasement, his defiance in the face of German bombing of England, his political prowess, his deft aphorisms, and his memorable speeches.

<p>Summary : As the newspaper clipping falls from the cardboard box Tegan takes in the woman in the picture: her chestnut hair, her eyes full of laughter, the way she nestles against the man beside her. And as she reads the words in the article, Tegan almost stops breathing. Was coming here a terrible mistake?When Tegan?s family is torn apart by a terrible tragedy, she runs away in search of somewhere to keep safe from the past that haunts her, and the painful secrets she?s never told anyone. Arriving in Copper Canyon, Colorado, where wooden storefronts line the quiet streets and no-one knows her name, Tegan breathes easy for the first time in years. And when she grows close with Jack, another lost soul who won?t talk about his home, it seems she?s found the perfect companion to explore the mountain landscapes with.But just as Tegan starts to think maybe safety isn?t a place, it?s a person, she notices the box of photos and newspaper clippings that Jack takes everywhere in the trunk of his car. </p>

<p>Summary : As the newspaper clipping falls from the cardboard box Tegan takes in the woman in the picture: her chestnut hair, her eyes full of laughter, the way she nestles against the man beside her. And as she reads the words in the article, Tegan almost stops breathing. Was coming here a terrible mistake?When Tegan?s family is torn apart by a terrible tragedy, she runs away in search of somewhere to keep safe from the past that haunts her, and the painful secrets she?s never told anyone. Arriving in Copper Canyon, Colorado, where wooden storefronts line the quiet streets and no-one knows her name, Tegan breathes easy for the first time in years. And when she grows close with Jack, another lost soul who won?t talk about his home, it seems she?s found the perfect companion to explore the mountain landscapes with.But just as Tegan starts to think maybe safety isn?t a place, it?s a person, she notices the box of photos and newspaper clippings that Jack takes everywhere in the trunk of his car. </p>

<p>Summary : Nell&#8217;arco di una vita Dino Solbiati si ? costruito una fortuna diventando un grande imprenditore conosciuto in tutto il mondo per la generosit? e la simpatia. Come un sovrano vive circondato da uno stuolo di amici e collaboratori dei quali non pu? fare a meno, perch? teme la solitudine.

Gli spiega che si trovano entrambi in Paradiso e, curiosa com&#8217;?, lo induce a parlare di s?. Emerge cos? una biografia ricca di avventure fra intrighi e passioni che trascinano </p>

<p>Summary : Listening Length: 13 hours and 17 minutes Diana Dixon has a lot going on this summer. She?s rehearsing for a ballroom dance competition, juggling two jobs, and dealing with an ex-boyfriend who can?t take the hint it?s over. Yet despite all that, she still has plenty of time and energy to tell Shane Lindley to screw off.Shane just moved into her apartment building and seems dedicated to sleeping his way through her entire cheerleading squad. Sure, he?s a tall, gorgeous hockey player, but he?s messing with her turf. This calls for some ground rules: no parties in her apartment, leave her teammates alone, and?most importantly?leave her alone.What Diana doesn?t realize is that Shane?s sick of hookups and tired of being on the rebound after his long-term girlfriend called it quits. He wants a relationship. And when his ex comes back into the picture, he pretends he has one to make her jealous?and who better to play the girlfriend role than his sassy new neighbor?Despite Diana?s reluctance </p>

<p>Summary : Murder by poison alarmed, enthralled, and in many ways encapsulated the Victorian age. Linda Stratmann?s dark and splendid social history reveals the nineteenth century as a gruesome battleground where poisoners went head-to-head with authorities who strove to detect poisons, control their availability, and bring the guilty to justice. She corrects many misconceptions about particular poisons and documents how the evolution of issues such as marital rights and the legal protection of children impacted poisonings. Combining archival research with a novelist?s eye, Stratmann charts the era?s inexorable rise of poison cases both shocking and sad.</p>

Linda Stratmann?s dark and splendid social history reveals the nineteenth century as a gruesome battleground where poisoners went head-to-head with authorities who strove to detect poisons, control their availability, and bring the guilty to justice. She corrects many misconceptions about particular poisons and documents how the evolution of issues such as marital rights and the legal protection of children impacted poisonings. Combining archival research with a novelist?s eye, Stratmann charts the era?s inexorable rise of poison cases both shocking and sad.</p>

<p>Summary : Sixth in the Kurt Wallander series.In an African convent, four nuns and a unidentified fifth woman are brutally murdered&#8211;the death of the unknown woman covered up by the local police. A year later in Sweden, Inspector Kurt Wallander is baffled and appalled by two murders. Holger Eriksson, a retired car dealer and bird watcher, is impaled on sharpened bamboo poles in a ditch behind his secluded home, and the body of a missing florist is discovered&#8211;strangled and tied to a tree. The only clues Wallander has to go on are a skull, a diary, and a photo of three men. What ensues is a case that will test Wallander?s strength and patience, because in order to discover the reason behind these murders, he will also need to uncover the elusive connection between these deaths and the earlier unsolved murder in Africa of the fifth woman.</p>

<p>Summary : undefined A DISRUPTIVE, FULFILLMENT-FIRST APPROACH TO LIVING IN THE MODERN AGE BY 27- YEAR-OLD ENTREPRENEUR AND CEO OF SOCIAL CHAIN, STEVEN BARTLETT  Happy Sexy Millionaire: Unexpected Truths about Fulfillment, Love and Success is a crucial intervention for a society that is going in the wrong direction, offering actionable advice to help improve your mindset.  Steven unapologetically and humorously challenges widely-accepted, often damaging clich?s on topics of happiness, love and success, and replaces them with bold, science- backed and unconventional principles for surviving.  In a world where we&#8217;re told that we must make sacrifices to become successful, Steven teaches us how to achieve personal success without losing sight of the other things that make life fundamentally worthwhile. He shows us that money and happiness aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive or hard to attain for anyone, if you understand the simple principles that both are based on.

<p>Summary : It&#8217;s hard to describe David Sedaris to those who&#8217;ve never read him. Mixing autobiographical details with sharp sarcasm and social commentary, Sedaris can probably best be described as a &#8217;90s version of brilliant humorist Jean Shepherd (who did his own scathing take on the holiday season with the film A Christmas Story). Sedaris&#8217; essays and stories are at once hilarious, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking. His new anthology, Holidays on Ice, collects three previously released stories and essays and offers three brand-new ones; all revolve around Christmas. P&#8221;SantaLand Diaries,&#8221; which originally appeared in &#8220;Barrel Fever,&#8221; leads off the collection and may be Sedaris&#8217;s best-known work. A laugh-out-loud-hysterical look at Sedaris&#8217;s experiences working as an elf in SantaLand in Macy&#8217;s, the story is a wickedly funny slicing-and-dicing of the holiday season and the good cheer that supposedly accompanies it. His dark humor is exactly what you need when you&#8217;re getting sick of all the fuss </p>

<p>Summary : ?Simple beautiful food to electrify the tastebuds.?-vMeera SodhaFrom the beloved author of Coconut &amp; Sambal, a cookbook on how to create authentic east and southeast Asian flavors at home using common ingredients, quickly and with minimal effort.Lara Lee used to spend her afternoons wandering slowly through Asian markets, gathering ingredients for an impressive banquet meal she would make later for friends and family. Then her son Jonah came into the world, and everything changed. Time for shopping, cooking, and washing dishes drastically decreased. But Lara wouldn&#8217;t allow her food to become lackluster or uninspired. In A Splash of Soy, she shares 100 recipes created to honor tradition but respect our time: every meal takes less than 45 minutes to prepare, cook, and serve. Convenient as they are, the recipes in A Splash of Soy capture all the exquisite elements of Asian cooking: from the striking balance of sweet, sour, salty, umami, bitter and spicy, to the soft, slippery chew </p>

<p>Summary : People describe Jesus in a lot of different ways, but have you ever thought of Him as relaxed? This doesn&#8217;t mean that Jesus didn&#8217;t grieve or become angry, but the Gospels portray Him as never in a hurry to be anywhere other than where He was, trusting and obeying His Father.Could the same be said of you? Are you relaxed? You can be. We long to know peace, purpose, and contentment, but life&#8217;s stresses, the world&#8217;s discouragements, and our own striving for growth often get in the way.Join Bible teacher and spiritual formation leader Megan Fate Marshman for a seven-session Bible study on exchanging self-reliance for the trusting and relaxed posture modeled to us by Jesus.Designed for use with Relaxed Bible Study Guide plus Streaming Video, sold separately.The Audio Bible Studies series provides a unique audio learning experience. Unlike a traditional audiobook&#8217;s direct narration of a book&#8217;s text, this audio Bible study includes high-quality, live audio sessions from the author that </p>

<p>Summary : A revised and updated edition of the acclaimed Wall Street Journal bestseller that explores why some leaders drain capability and intelligence from their teams while others amplify it to produce better results.We?ve all had experience with two dramatically different types of leaders. The first type drains intelligence, energy, and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people?s heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders are expected to do more </p>

<p>Summary : Las teor?as tibetanas dicen que los hijos eligen a los padres. Seg?n esta visi?n de la vida, tres meses antes de iniciar la gestaci?n, cada alma elige de acuerdo con las lecciones que debe aprender en esta vida. De los v?nculos divinos en la Tierra, el m?s poderoso es el de la madre, porque nos genera un aprendizaje profundo, tan doloroso que a veces lastima; tan amoroso que, en ocasiones, mutila y sobreprotege. Todo en nombre del amor. // Tibetan theories say that children choose parents, three months before the start of a pregnancy. Each soul chooses according to the lessons to be learned in this life. Of the divine bonds on Earth, the most powerful is that of the Mother, because it generates a deep learning. All in the name of love.</p>

<p>Summary : SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES is BOOK 1 of 7 in the legal thriller series featuring Mike Daley &amp; Rosie Fernandez.  Debut author Sheldon Siegel bursts into the legal thriller arena with a riveting courtroom drama, exposing the world of big-time law firms and lawyers in a fresh, sharp-witted, wonderfully sardonic page-turner.  Meet Mike Daley. Ex-priest. Ex?public defender. And as of yesterday, ex-partner in one of San Francisco&#8217;s most prominent law firms. Today he&#8217;s out on his own, setting up practice on the wrong side of town. Then his best friend and former colleague is charged with a brutal double murder, and Daley is instantly catapulted into a high-profile investigation involving the prestigious law firm that just booted him.  As he prepares his case, Daley uncovers the firm&#8217;s dirtiest secrets. It doesn&#8217;t take long for him to discover that in this trial, ambition, friendship, greed, and long-standing grudges will play just as important a role as truth and justice.  Brilliantly paced, </p>

What were the similar choices made by Mozart and by Caesar Rodriguez, the U.S. Air Force&#8217;s last ace fighter pilot? In Mastery, Robert Greene&#8217;s fifth book, he mines the biographies of great historical figures for clues about gaining control over our own lives and destinies.

<p>Summary : Welcome to Phantasma.There are only two rules to the game. Stay alive. And don?t fall in love.When Ophelia?s sister disappears, there is only one way to save her. Ophelia must enter Phantasma, a deadly contest inside a haunted mansion, and claim its prize?a single wish.Phantasma is a maze of twisting corridors and lavish ballrooms, of demons and temptations. Ophelia will face nine challenges, each more dangerous than the last. There can only be one winner, and the other contestants will stop at nothing to eliminate their rivals.Every day the house creates new monsters.

Mats und Matilda sind sich einig, dass hier nur noch Spekulatius helfen kann. Der kleine Weihnachtsdrache ist nach ihrem letzten Abenteuer wieder nach Hause auf die Weihnachtsinsel geflogen, doch jetzt eilt er den Kindern zu Hilfe. Er hat n?mlich einen Verdacht, wer f?r das Weihnachtschaos verantwortlich sein k?nnte. Jemand, der Weihnachten nicht leiden kann ?</p>

<p>Summary : Teach history in a way that&#8217;s fascinating to visual learners and children who are captivated by pictures and timelines. When on Earth? approaches history in a different way than most books, giving context that can put what children learn in school in a broader historical perspective. In more than 60 specially commissioned maps, this one-of-a-kind history book shows where, when, and how history happened. Find out how the first farmers lived and worked. Discover the Viking world. Learn about the Arab Spring. Beautiful illustrations, 3-D graphics, clear annotations, and fun facts bring history to life and show how it fits in to the world at large. Whether your child is a visual learner or a geography buff, When on Earth? is perfect for any student of history, giving a guide to our shared past and a birds-eye view of the history of life on Earth.</p>

<p>Summary : Tired of the fast-paced metropolitan life, Izuki has agreed to move into his uncle&#8217;s house in the mountains ? a place that is said to &#8220;be visited by yokai.&#8221;Believing it to be superstition, Izuki goes exploring only to be attacked by a yokai in the woods. He&#8217;s saved by a beautiful man named Haku, who claims to be the incarnation of a komainu guardian dog. He pledges himself to Izuki and begs him to be his master. Izuki refuses at first, wanting to return to the city as quickly as possible, but is swayed by Haku&#8217;s lonely eyes and brings him back to the house. Gradually, they fall into a comfortable rhythm with the pushy but devoted Haku while living under the same roof, and Izuki wonders if he really wants to return to the city as he thought.However, Haku harbors a secret that could put Izuki&#8217;s life at risk. Will Izuki and Haku come together in the end, or will Haku succumb to the loneliness that he&#8217;s held off for centuries&#8230;? <br />

<p>Summary : New York Times bestselling author Carolyn Brown?s bighearted novel about family, secrets, small-town Texas romance, and?with a little bit of luck?starting over. Family doesn?t mean everyone has to like each other. That?s the case when cousins Taryn, Anna Rose, and Jorja return to Shamrock, Texas, to help manage their grandmother?s flower shop, the Lucky Shamrock. The reunion isn?t exactly a beautiful arrangement?considering they?re as compatible as ranchers and coyotes. Thank heaven for a handsome go-between like Clinton, who lives above the shop. The easygoing war vet, and most eligible bachelor in Wheeler County, is now throwing romance into the mix and setting the local women to gossiping. But as the hot months wear on, hidden secrets begin to surface for the temperamental Irish trio. And it?s bringing them closer together than they ever thought possible. With a flurry of weddings, a love story in the making, a surprise baby, and crazy good fortune, maybe that shamrock painted on </p>
