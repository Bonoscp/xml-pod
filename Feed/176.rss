<p>Summary : A lot of professors give talks titled &#8216;The Last Lecture&#8217;. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn&#8217;t have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, &#8216;Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams&#8217;, wasn&#8217;t about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an </p>

<p>Summary : Um guia ilustrado para programadores e outros curiosos. Um algoritmo nada mais ? do que um procedimento passo a passo para a resolu??o de um problema. Os algoritmos que voc? mais utilizar? como um programador j? foram descobertos, testados e provados. Se voc? quer entend?-los, mas se recusa a estudar p?ginas e mais p?ginas de provas, este ? o livro certo. Este guia cativante e completamente ilustrado torna simples aprender como utilizar os principais algoritmos nos seus programas. O livro Entendendo Algoritmos apresenta uma abordagem agrad?vel para esse t?pico essencial da ci?ncia da computa??o. Nele, voc? aprender? como aplicar algoritmos comuns nos problemas de programa??o enfrentados diariamente. Voc? come?ar? com tarefas b?sicas como a ordena??o e a pesquisa. Com a pr?tica, voc? enfrentar? problemas mais complexos, como a compress?o de dados e a intelig?ncia artificial. Cada exemplo ? apresentado em detalhes e inclui diagramas e c?digos completos em Python. Ao final deste livro, </p>

<p>Summary : We&#8217;re told that to achieve more we need to work longer, focus harder, sacrifice more. But it&#8217;s a lie.Because the secret to true productivity isn&#8217;t graft. It&#8217;s joy.In this revolutionary book, Ali Abdaal, Cambridge-educated doctor and the world&#8217;s most-followed productivity expert, offers a scientifically proven way to get more done &#8211; by finding radical pleasure in everything you do. He starts by introducing the three &#8216;energisers&#8217; that make work invigorating rather than draining &#8211; Power, Play and People. Then he delves into cutting-edge science that reveals how to integrate these forces into your daily routine &#8211; so you end every day feeling uplifted rather than exhausted.The result is a revolutionary way to get more done without stressing out, freaking out or burning out.

<p>Summary : From the author of This Is Happiness, a compassionate, life-affirming novel about the Christmas season that transforms the small Irish town of Faha.Doctor Jack Troy was born and raised in Faha, but his responsibilities for the sick and his care for the dying mean he has always been set apart from the town. His eldest daughter, Ronnie, has grown up in her father&#8217;s shadow, and remains there, having missed one chance at love ? and passed up another offer of marriage from an unsuitable man.But in the Advent season of 1962, as the town readies itself for Christmas, Ronnie and Doctor Troy&#8217;s lives are turned upside down when a baby is left in their care. As the winter passes, father and daughter&#8217;s lives, the understanding of their family, and their role in their community are changed forever.Set over the course of one December in the same village as Williams&#8217; beloved This Is Happiness, Time of the Child is a tender return to Faha for readers who know its charms, and a heartwarming welcome </p>

Yazar?n yap?tlar?na ve esin dolu d?nyas?na ad?m atmak i?in m?kemmel bir giri? metni olan mektup, ayn? zamanda 20. y?zy?l edebiyat tarihinin b?y?k itiraflar?ndan biri say?labilir.Kafka, su?lay?c? bir tonla hafif bir ironinin birbirine kar??t??? mektubunda, babas? taraf?ndan kabul g?rme talebini dillendirir. Asl?nda babas?yla aras?ndaki yabanc?la?ma ve ileti?imsizli?i, yap?tlar?n?n ?o?unda kendine mesele edindi?i daha geni? kapsaml? varolu?sal bir a?maz?n par?as? olarak g?r?yordu. Yazar evlili?e ve yeti?kin bir erkek olmaya haz?rlanan Georg Bendemann adl? karakterinin babas? taraf?ndan ?l?me mahk?m edildi?i Yarg? adl? ?yk?s?nde oldu?u gibi, evlenememesinden ve yeti?kin olamamas?ndan babas?n? sorumlu tutuyordu.Ba?ar?l? bir i?adam? olan Hermann Kafka&#8217;n?n o?luyla ili?kisinde, i?lerini devam ettirecek tek erkek evlad?na y?nelik geleneksel beklentisi belirleyici olmu?tu. Bu, yeni olu?mu? </p>

<p>Summary : 1967: Ye Wenjie witnesses Red Guards beat her father to death during China&#8217;s Cultural Revolution. This singular event will shape not only the rest of her life but also the future of mankind. Four decades later, Beijing police ask nanotech engineer Wang Miao to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientists after a spate of inexplicable suicides. Wang&#8217;s investigation will lead him to a mysterious online game and immerse him in a virtual world ruled by the intractable and unpredictable interaction of its three suns. This is the Three-Body Problem and it is the key to everything: the key to the scientists&#8217; deaths, the key to a conspiracy that spans light-years and the key to the extinction-level threat humanity now faces.</p>

<p>Summary : 1967: Ye Wenjie witnesses Red Guards beat her father to death during China&#8217;s Cultural Revolution. This singular event will shape not only the rest of her life but also the future of mankind. Four decades later, Beijing police ask nanotech engineer Wang Miao to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientists after a spate of inexplicable suicides. Wang&#8217;s investigation will lead him to a mysterious online game and immerse him in a virtual world ruled by the intractable and unpredictable interaction of its three suns. This is the Three-Body Problem and it is the key to everything: the key to the scientists&#8217; deaths, the key to a conspiracy that spans light-years and the key to the extinction-level threat humanity now faces.</p>

<p>Summary : The provocative and hilarious summer read that will have book lovers cheering and everyone talking! Kirsten Miller, author of The Change, brings us a bracing, wildly entertaining satire about a small Southern town, a pitched battle over banned books, and a little lending library that changes everything.Beverly Underwood and her arch enemy, Lula Dean, live in the tiny town of Troy, Georgia, where they were born and raised. Now Beverly is on the school board, and Lula has become a local celebrity by embarking on mission to rid the public libraries of all inappropriate books?none of which she?s actually read. To replace the ?pornographic? books she?s challenged at the local public library, Lula starts her own lending library in front of her home: a cute wooden hutch with glass doors and neat rows of the worthy literature that she?s sure the town?s readers need.But Beverly?s daughter Lindsay sneaks in by night and secretly fills Lula Dean?s little free library with banned books wrapped </p>

<p>Summary : A House established. A Wolf on the run. And with his foes multiplying, can Michael accomplish all that he must?Michael has taken the Game by the throat. No longer content to lurk in the shadows, he has started down a path that will inevitably bring him into conflict with the Powers.But the Powers are no easy foes. Nor are they Michael?s only adversaries.Other enemies stir. Some confront him openly, while others watch patiently from the sidelines. A lone wolf no more, and with many of his own pieces in play, Michael may find himself more exposed than he believes.The stakes are high. And the schemes of the players convoluted.Evading entanglement will not be simple. Avoiding the ire of the Powers will be even harder. And escaping the attention of beings beyond his ken may well be impossible. Can Michael trace a delicate balance between obscurity and strength? Or will his dreams for House Wolf end in ashes?</p>

<p>Summary : This ?powerful and disturbing? (Bill Browder, author of Red Notice) New York Times bestseller is narrated by a man who, with his wife, Whitney Duan, rose to the top levels of power and wealth?and then fell out of favor. Whitney had been disappeared four years before, but this book led to her dramatic reemergence.As Desmond Shum was growing up impoverished in China, he vowed his life would be different. Through hard work and sheer tenacity he earned an American college degree and returned to his native country to establish himself in business. There, he met his future wife, the highly intelligent and equally ambitious Whitney Duan who was determined to make her mark within China?s male-dominated society. Whitney and Desmond formed an effective team and, aided by relationships they formed with top members of China?s Communist Party, the so-called red aristocracy, he vaulted into China?s billionaire class. Soon they were developing the massive air cargo facility at Beijing International </p>

<p>Summary : Determine Your Future by the Words You Speak Today &#8220;&#8221;Words satisfy the soul as food satisfies the stomach; the right words on a person&#8217;s lips bring satisfaction.&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;Proverbs 18:30, NLT We all know that words carry enormous power&#8211;the power to heal or to wound, to encourage or to dishearten, to speak truth or to deceive, to praise or to criticize. They can be the key to our success or the reason for our downfall. So, how do we harness that power? How do we learn to use our words to their greatest potential? &#8220;The Power of Your Words&#8221; will take you on a journey of discovery into more than just the obvious impact your words can have. Find out how to live more freely; how to connect more meaningfully; how to undo the damage of your words; and, most important, how to pause, ponder and then pray before speaking. Robert Morris wants you to know that good words last, and they carry enormous power to help, heal, encourage and move us to a greater level of living.</p>

<p>Summary : The fourth novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the best of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path that can only end in fire.Hadrian Marlowe is trapped.For nearly a century, he has been a guest of the Emperor, forced into the role of advisor, a prisoner of his own legend. But the war is changing. Mankind is losing.The Cielcin are spilling into human space from the fringes, picking their targets with cunning precision. The Great Prince Syriani Dorayaica is uniting their clans, forging them into an army and threat the likes of which mankind has never seen.And the Empire stands alone.Now the Emperor has no choice but to give Hadrian Marlowe&#8211;once his favorite knight&#8211;one more impossible task: journey across the galaxy to the Lothrian Commonwealth and convince them to join the war. But not all is as it seems, and Hadrian&#8217;s journey will take him far beyond the Empire, beyond the Commonwealth, impossibly deep behind enemy lines.</p>

<p>Summary : Jillian Lauren had no idea what she was getting into when she wrote her first letter to prolific serial killer Samuel Little. All she knew was her research had led her to believe he was good for far more murders than the three for which he had been convicted. While the two exchanged dozens of letters and embarked on hundreds of hours of interviews, Lauren gained the trust of a monster. After maintaining his innocence for decades, Little confessed to the murders of ninety-three women, often drawing his victims in haunting detail as he spoke. How could one man evade justice, manipulating the system for over four decades? As the FBI, the DOJ, the LAPD, and countless law enforcement officials across the country worked to connect their cold cases with the confessions, Lauren&#8217;s coverage of the investigations and obsession with Little&#8217;s victims only escalated.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Who am I becoming?&#8221; That was the question nagging pastor and author John Mark Comer. Outwardly, he appeared successful. But inwardly, things weren&#8217;t pretty. So he turned to a trusted mentor for guidance and heard these words:&#8221;Ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life. Hurry is the great enemy of the spiritual life.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t the response he expected, but it was&#8211;and continues to be&#8211;the answer he needs. Too often we treat the symptoms of toxicity in our modern world instead of trying to pinpoint the cause. A growing number of voices are pointing at hurry, or busyness, as a root of much evil.Within the pages of this book, you&#8217;ll find a fascinating roadmap to staying emotionally healthy and spiritually alive in the chaos of the modern world.</p>

<p>Summary : Bestselling author Alice Hoffman delivers a stunning novel about one of contemporary history&#8217;s most acclaimed figures, exploring the little-known details of Anne Frank&#8217;s life before she went into hiding.Anne Frank&#8217;s The Diary of a Young Girl has captivated and inspired readers for decades. Published posthumously by her bereaved father, Anne&#8217;s journal, written while she and her family were in hiding during World War II, has become one of the central texts of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust, as well as a work of literary genius.With the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, the Frank family&#8217;s life is turned inside out, blow by blow, restriction by restriction. Prejudice, loss, and terror run rampant, and Anne is forced to bear witness as ordinary people become monsters, and children and families are caught up in the inescapable tide of violence.In the midst of impossible danger, Anne, audacious and creative and fearless, discovers who she truly is. With a wisdom far beyond her </p>

But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and worries that she can&#8217;t turn off.

Yet Sam knows she&#8217;d be truly crazy to leave the protection of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam&#8217;s weekly visits to her psychiatrist.Caroline introduces Sam to Poet&#8217;s Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits who have been ignored by the school at large.

<p>Summary : The dramatic inside story of the first four historic flights that launched SpaceX &#8211; and Elon Musk &#8211; from a shaky startup into the world&#8217;s leading edge rocket company.?In 2006, SpaceX &#8211; a brand-new venture with fewer than 200 employees &#8211; rolled its first, single-engine rocket onto a launch pad at Kwajalein Atoll. After a groundbreaking launch from the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Falcon 1 rocket designed by Elon Musk?s engineers rose in the air for approximately thirty seconds. Then, its engine flamed out, and the rocket crashed back into the ocean.?In 2007, SpaceX undertook a second launch. This time, the rocket rose far into space, but just before reaching orbit it spun out of control. Confident of success in 2008, Musk and his team launched their third rocket with several paying customers. The first stage executed perfectly, but instead of falling away, it thudded into the second stage. Another failure. Elon Musk had only budgeted for three attempts when he founded SpaceX.Out </p>

<p>Summary : Ivan is an easygoing gorilla. Living at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade, he has grown accustomed to humans watching him through the glass walls of his domain. He rarely misses his life in the jungle. In fact, he hardly ever thinks about it at all.Instead, Ivan thinks about TV shows he?s seen and about his friends Stella, an elderly elephant, and Bob, a stray dog. But mostly Ivan thinks about art and how to capture the taste of a mango or the sound of leaves with color and a well-placed line.Then he meets Ruby, a baby elephant taken from her family, and she makes Ivan see their home?and his own art?through new eyes. When Ruby arrives, change comes with her, and it?s up to Ivan to make it a change for the better.Katherine Applegate blends humor and poignancy to create Ivan?s unforgettable first-person narration in a story of friendship, art, and hope.</p>

<p>Summary : In his first work of nonfiction since The Innocent Man, #1 bestselling author John Grisham and Centurion Ministries Founder Jim McCloskey share ten harrowing true stories of wrongful convictions. Impeccably researched and grippingly told, Framed offers an inside look at the injustice faced by the victims of the United States criminal justice system.A fundamental principle of our legal system is a presumption of innocence, but once someone has been found guilty there is very little room to prove doubt. Framed shares ten true stories of men who were innocent but found guilty and forced to sacrifice friends, families, wives, and decades of their lives to prison while the guilty parties remained free. In each of the stories, John Grisham and Jim McCloskey recount the dramatic hard-fought battles for exoneration. They take a close look at what leads to wrongful convictions in the first place, and the racism, misconduct, flawed testimony, and the corrupt court system that can make them so </p>

<p>Summary : In his first work of nonfiction since The Innocent Man, #1 bestselling author John Grisham and Centurion Ministries Founder Jim McCloskey share ten harrowing true stories of wrongful convictions. Impeccably researched and grippingly told, Framed offers an inside look at the injustice faced by the victims of the United States criminal justice system.A fundamental principle of our legal system is a presumption of innocence, but once someone has been found guilty there is very little room to prove doubt. Framed shares ten true stories of men who were innocent but found guilty and forced to sacrifice friends, families, wives, and decades of their lives to prison while the guilty parties remained free. In each of the stories, John Grisham and Jim McCloskey recount the dramatic hard-fought battles for exoneration. They take a close look at what leads to wrongful convictions in the first place, and the racism, misconduct, flawed testimony, and the corrupt court system that can make them so </p>

<p>Summary : Welcome to the Gun Show! The top ten list is populated. The sponsorship program is open. The difficulty is ramping up. The first three floors were nothing compared to what Carl and Donut now face. The Iron Tangle. An impossibly-complicated subway system built out of the world&#8217;s subterranean railway systems, all combined and then tied together into a knot. Up is down. Down is up. Close is far. The cars are filled with monsters, the railway stations are less than safe, and the exit is always just a few stops away.But there is hope. For the first time, the crawlers are all working together. The loot is better than ever. And the secret to unraveling it all may be hidden in the pages of a seemingly-useless book. Welcome, crawlers. Welcome to the fourth floor of the dungeon.</p>

<p>Summary : Disgraced, ex-detective Harper Adams is perfectly content wallowing at rock bottom. She?s lost her job, house, and reputation, and it only gets worse when she?s forced to move back home to Jackson Creek, Arkansas, the one place she swore she?d never return. But everything changes when she gets chilling news. A childhood friend?s daughter is missing?and it?s eerily reminiscent of Harper?s sister?s kidnapping and murder two decades ago. Not her business. Except with the police fumbling the case at every turn, Harper realizes she might be the only one who can save the girl. And she might need the help of James Malcolm, a former crime boss, to do it.</p>

<p>Summary : Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1966 in Pulaski, Tennessee, Bocephus Haynes watched in horror as his father was brutally murdered by ten local members of the Ku Klux Klan. As an African American lawyer practicing in the birthplace of the Klan years later, Bo has spent his life pursuing justice in his father?s name. But when Andy Walton, the man believed to have led the lynch mob forty-five years earlier, ends up murdered in the same spot as Bo?s father, Bo becomes the prime suspect.Retired law professor Tom McMurtrie, Bo?s former teacher and friend, is a year removed from returning to the courtroom. Now McMurtrie and his headstrong partner, Rick Drake, must defend Bo on charges of capital murder while hunting for Andy Walton?s true killer. In a courtroom clash that will put their reputations and lives at stake, can McMurtrie and Drake release Bo from a lifetime of despair? Or will justice remain hidden somewhere between black and white?</p>
