<p>Summary : Librarian note: An alternative cover for this ISBN can be found here.La Metamorfosis podr?a leerse como la autobiograf?a de Franz Kafka, tanto por su crudeza cr?tica hacia la sociedad de su tiempo como por sus pasajes de desolaci?n y tristeza expresados a trav?s de su personaje principal, Gregorio Samsa. La historia cuenta la transformaci?n de un hombre, sustento de su familia y que, una noche dif?cil, queda convertido en insecto. El relato est? dividido en tres partes, unidas mediante el tema central de la melancol?a que padece Samsa al sentirse repudiado por su familia. El final refleja una de las caracter?sticas humanas m?s tristes, por lo que se considera como una obra dentro de la literatura existencialista, la cual tuvo una repercusi?n sobresaliente en el pensamiento europeo del siglo XX.</p>

<p>Summary : When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn?t become scientists, she decided she would.Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book?s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ?a curiosity ?of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions. The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Brain on Fire <br />
 meets High Achiever in this visceral, propulsive memoir detailing a woman?s accidental descent into prescription benzodiazepine dependence and the life-threatening impacts of the drugs? long-term use.As Melissa Bond raises her infant daughter and a special-needs one-year-old son, she suffers from unbearable insomnia, sleeping an hour or less each night. She loses her job as a journalist (a casualty of the 2008 recession), and her relationship with her husband grows distant. Her doctor casually prescribes benzodiazepines?a family of drugs that includes Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Ativan???and increases her dosage on a regular basis.  Following her doctor?s orders, Melissa takes the pills night after night; her body begins to shut down and she collapses while holding her infant daughter. Only then does Melissa learn that her doctor?like many doctors?has over-prescribed the medication and quitting cold turkey could lead to psychosis or fatal seizures. Benzodiazepine </p>

<p>Summary : When female wolf shifter Taryn Warner first encounters Trey Coleman, an alpha male wolf shifter with a dangerous reputation, she?s determined to resist his charms. After all, Trey?who was only fourteen when he defeated his own father in a duel, winning the right to be alpha of his pack?can?t have anything to offer the talented healer besides trouble, or so she thinks.Taryn finds herself drawn in by Trey?s forceful demeanor and arctic-blue eyes, and she eventually agrees to enter an uneasy alliance with him. If the two succeed in convincing their respective packs that they?ve chosen each other as mates, Trey will win valuable political allies, while Taryn will escape an odious arranged mating.But there are a lot of potential pitfalls to this plan?including the very real possibility that the wolf shifters, overwhelmed by their growing attraction to each other, will be unable to maintain the clear heads needed to pull off the deception.</p>

<p>Summary : When female wolf shifter Taryn Warner first encounters Trey Coleman, an alpha male wolf shifter with a dangerous reputation, she?s determined to resist his charms. After all, Trey?who was only fourteen when he defeated his own father in a duel, winning the right to be alpha of his pack?can?t have anything to offer the talented healer besides trouble, or so she thinks.Taryn finds herself drawn in by Trey?s forceful demeanor and arctic-blue eyes, and she eventually agrees to enter an uneasy alliance with him. If the two succeed in convincing their respective packs that they?ve chosen each other as mates, Trey will win valuable political allies, while Taryn will escape an odious arranged mating.But there are a lot of potential pitfalls to this plan?including the very real possibility that the wolf shifters, overwhelmed by their growing attraction to each other, will be unable to maintain the clear heads needed to pull off the deception.</p>

<p>Summary : Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters.</p>

<p>Summary : A wrenching debut memoir of familial grief by a National Book Award finalist&#8211;and a defining account of what it means to love and lose a difficult parent.When Christopher Sorrentino&#8217;s mother died in 2017, it marked the end of a journey that had begun eighty years earlier in the South Bronx.

<p>Summary : Margaret Atwood&#8217;s The Robber Bride is inspired by &#8220;The Robber Bridegroom,&#8221; a wonderfully grisly tale from the Brothers Grimm in which an evil groom lures three maidens into his lair and devours them, one by one. But in her version, Atwood brilliantly recasts the monster as Zenia, a villainess of demonic proportions, and sets her loose in the lives of three friends, Tony,? Charis, and Roz. All three &#8220;have lost men, spirit, money, and time to their old college acquaintance, Zenia. At various times, and in various emotional disguises, Zenia has insinuated her way into their lives and practically demolished them. To Tony, who almost lost her husband and jeopardized her academic career, Zenia is &#8216;a lurking enemy??commando.&#8217; To Roz, who did lose her husband and almost her magazine, Zenia is &#8216;a cold and treacherous bitch.&#8217; To Charis, who lost a boyfriend, quarts of vegetable juice and some pet chickens, Zenia is a kind of zombie, maybe &#8216;soulless'&#8221; (Lorrie Moore, New York Times </p>

Dozier Boys School was a well-guarded secret in Florida for over a century, until reports of cruelty, abuse, and &#8220;mysterious&#8221; deaths shut the institution down in 2011. Established in 1900, the juvenile reform school accepted children as young as six years of age for crimes as harmless as truancy or trespassing. The boys sent there, many of whom were Black, were subject to brutal abuse, routinely hired out to local farmers by the school&#8217;s management as indentured labor, and died either at the school or attempting to escape its brutal conditions.In the wake of the school&#8217;s shutdown, Erin Kimmerle, a leading forensic anthropologist, stepped in to locate the school&#8217;s graveyard to determine the </p>

<p>Summary : Darren Street faces the most personal and ruthless vendetta of his life.After forfeiting years serving time for a false murder conviction, former criminal defense attorney Darren Street finally got his freedom back and is trying to build a regular life. But when an unthinkable tragedy shatters his hard-earned normalcy, Street is left reeling from the devastating blow.As the criminal-justice system refuses to dispense justice, he sets out?without mercy?after the man responsible. Unwilling to stop at simply righting one wrong, Street decides to dust off his legal skills and dive back in?this time to unseat the district attorney general in Knoxville, whose callous indifference nearly let a man get away with murder.Now navigating a broken establishment already steeped in corruption, Street will find the retribution and redemption he so desperately needs?unless it draws him even deeper into the very chaos that derailed his life in the first place.</p>

<p>Summary : Diana Bishop journeys to the darkest places within herself?and her family history?in the highly anticipated fifth novel of the beloved #1 New York Times bestselling All Souls series. Deborah Harkness first introduced the world to Diana Bishop, Oxford scholar and witch, and vampire geneticist Matthew de Clairmont in A Discovery of Witches. Drawn to each other despite long-standing taboos, these two otherworldly beings found themselves at the center of a battle for a lost, enchanted manuscript known as Ashmole 782. Since then, they have fallen in love, traveled to Elizabethan England, dissolved the Covenant between the three species, and awoken the dark powers within Diana?s family line.  Now, Diana and Matthew receive a formal demand from the Congregation: They must test the magic of their seven-year-old twins, Pip and Rebecca. Concerned with their safety and desperate to avoid the same fate that led her parents to spellbind her, Diana decides to forge a different path for her </p>

However, the people of Bruncliffe aren&#8217;t that welcoming to a man they see as trouble.Delilah Metcalfe, meanwhile, is struggling to keep her business, the Dales Dating Agency, afloat &#8211; as well as trying to control her wayward Weimaraner dog, Tolpuddle. Then when Samson gets his first case, investigating the supposed suicide of a local man, things take an unexpected turn, and soon he discovers a trail of deaths that lead back to the door of Delilah&#8217;s agency. With suspicion hanging over someone they both care for, the two feuding neighbours soon realize that they need to work together to solve the mystery of the dating deaths. But working together is easier said than done . . .</p>

A obra cont?m, ainda, a ?nica hist?ria que restou sobre as longas eras de N?menor antes de sua queda, e tudo o que se conhece sobre temas como os Cinco Magos, as Palant?ri ou a lenda de Amroth. Os contos foram reunidos e editados pelo filho e herdeiro liter?rio do autor, Christopher Tolkien, que fornece um breve coment?rio sobre cada hist?ria, ajudando o leitor a preencher as lacunas e a colocar cada uma no contexto dos demais escritos de seu pai.</p>

<p>Summary : On the night Rune?s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is. Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe &#8211; a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution &#8211; who she can&#8217;t help but find herself falling for. Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune?s merchant ships to smuggle renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He soon </p>

In 1999, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology admitted to discriminating against women on its faculty, forcing institutions across the country to confront a problem they had long ignored: the need for more women at the top levels of science. Written by the journalist who broke the story for The Boston Globe, The Exceptions is the untold story of how sixteen highly accomplished women on the MIT faculty came together to do the work that triggered the historic admission.

<p>Summary : From the Pulitzer Prize?winning journalist who broke the story, the inspiring account of the sixteen female scientists who forced MIT to publicly admit it had been discriminating against its female faculty for years?sparking a nationwide reckoning with the pervasive sexism in science. In 1999, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology admitted to discriminating against women on its faculty, forcing institutions across the country to confront a problem they had long ignored: the need for more women at the top levels of science. Written by the journalist who broke the story for The Boston Globe, The Exceptions is the untold story of how sixteen highly accomplished women on the MIT faculty came together to do the work that triggered the historic admission. The Exceptions centers on the life of Nancy Hopkins, a reluctant feminist who became the leader of the sixteen and a hero to two generations of women in science. Hired to prestigious universities at the dawn of affirmative action </p>

Why? Scientists are beginning to understand that the chronic diseases afflicting humans&#8211;cancer, obesity, diabetes, organ degeneration, and autoimmune disorders&#8211;also beset canines. As a result, our beloved companions are vexed with preventable health problems throughout much of their lives and suffer shorter life spans. Because our pets can&#8217;t make health and lifestyle decisions for themselves, it&#8217;s up to pet parents to make smart, science-backed choices for lasting vitality and health.The Forever Dog gives us the practical, proven tools to protect our loyal four-legged companions.

<p>Summary : Who and what are supercommunicators? They&#8217;re the people who can steer a conversation to a successful conclusion. They are able to talk about difficult topics without giving offence. They know how to make others feel at ease and share what they think. They&#8217;re brilliant facilitators and decision-guiders. How do they do it?In this groundbreaking book, Charles Duhigg unravels the secrets of the supercommunicators to reveal the art &#8211; and the science &#8211; of successful communication. He unpicks the different types of everyday conversation and pinpoints why some go smoothly while others swiftly fall apart. He reveals the conversational questions and gambits that bring people together. And he shows how even the most tricky of encounters can be turned around. In the process, he shows why a CIA operative was able to win over a reluctant spy, how a member of a jury got his fellow jurors to view an open-and-shut case differently, and what a doctor found they needed to do to engage with a vaccine </p>

<p>Summary : Hunting for evidence of the occult, Dr Montague invites three participants to Hill House: Theodora, his lovely assistant; Luke, set to inherit the estate; and Eleanor a fragile young woman with a troubled past. As The House takes hold, Jackson plumbs the depths of the human condition, asking the electric question: will any of them make it out? This definitive horror novel blurs the lines between reality and imagination, between dream and nightmare. Beautiful, atmospheric and utterly terrifying, Jackson?s magnum opus examines the shadows that lurk not just in cobwebbed corners, but in the facets of our very minds.</p>

<p>Summary : A pioneering researcher transforms our understanding of trauma and offers a bold new paradigm for healing. Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers&#8217; capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments?from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga?that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain&#8217;s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk&#8217;s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our </p>

<p>Summary : He can?t decide if he hates me or wants me.Vaughn Harding is my new boss. Getting close to him would be career suicide for a female racehorse trainer, and plain old gossip fuel in this small town. I get a kick out of our verbal sparring, but I swore off his type years ago.And I?ve got plans.I?m the new trainer at Gold Rush Ranch and I?ve just been handed a problem horse that I promised to make a winner. I want to put down roots, and I?m not about to let a man distract me. No matter how electric it feels when we lock eyes, or how my body ignites when we touch.Vaughn?s a vivid reminder of every guy I grew up around. Handsome, rich, entitled&#8211;a total media darling. But there?s a sadness in him that I can?t seem to turn my back on. A sensitive side hidden beneath brooding good looks.The last thing I need is a broken man to put back together, and the last thing he needs is more scandal.Teasing him for kicks is one thing, but handing over my heart?I should have known better.</p>

<p>Summary : From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity?s creation and evolution?a #1 international bestseller?that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ?human.?One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one?homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari </p>

<p>Summary : From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity?s creation and evolution?a #1 international bestseller?that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ?human.?One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one?homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari </p>

<p>Summary : A funny, biting, and entertaining memoir of coming of age in the shadow of celebrity and finding your own way in the face of absolute chaos that is both a moving portrait of a complicated family and an exploration of the cost of fame.Growing up, Jenny Pentland&#8217;s life was a literal sitcom. Many of the storylines for her mother&#8217;s smash hit series, Roseanne, were drawn from Pentland&#8217;s early family life in working-class Denver. But that was only the beginning of the drama. Roseanne Barr&#8217;s success as a comedian catapulted the family from the Rockies to star-studded Hollywood&#8211;with its toxic culture of money, celebrity, and prying tabloids that was destabilizing for a child in grade school.By adolescence, Jenny struggled with anxiety and eating issues. Her parents and new stepfather, struggling to help, responded by sending Jenny and her siblings on a grand tour of the self-help movement of the &#8217;80s&#8211;from fat camps to brat camps, wilderness survival programs to drug rehab clinics (even </p>

<p>Summary : A rugged mountain town seemed like the perfect escape from a life in shambles. But on day one I ran full tilt into the world?s hottest single dad and now all my plans are ruined.As a chart-topping country singer with a recent streak of bad press it?s hard to find any peace. But I find it in Rose Hill. With a little boy and a little girl who steal my heart just as thoroughly as their dad.Weston Belmont.The man is a shameless flirt. He oozes confidence and masculinity in a way that?s downright distracting. And in bed? He?s addictive.Everything with him is wild and impulsive and I?m desperate to regain some control.But no one has supported me like West does. And no one has ever made me feel as loved as he does either.So, while my brain says settling down with a small-town horse trainer is impossible? my heart says I?m right where I belong.Still, my life as a celebrity haunts me. It has the power to pull us apart.I can see in his eyes that wants me to stay. And I want that too.But I know </p>

<p>Summary : This title explores the formidable Me 262 and P-51 Mustang, two planes which represented the state-of-the-art in terms of design, performance, and combat capability for their respective air forces.Arguably two of the finest fighters built during the course of World War II, the Me 262 and P-51 Mustang heralded new dawns in aircraft performance. Making its operational debut in the summer of 1944, and powered by the Jumo 004 jet engine, the Me 262 outclassed Allied planes in terms of speed and firepower ratio, offering a formidable punch with four 30 mm MK 108 nose-mounted cannons. However, in the P-51, fitted with the Rolls-Royce (Packard) Merlin engine and drop-tanks, the USAAF finally had a fighter that had the &#8220;legs&#8221; to escort its heavy bombers deep into Reich airspace and back. If flown to its strengths, the P-51 was more than capable of taking on the feared Me 262 on an equal footing, despite the differences in power and top speed. Indeed, the Mustang proved to be the Luftwaffe </p>

<p>Summary : Laurent Fontaine has an obsession with spectacle. That is precisely the reason why he is the most famous art curator of the 20th century and why the Fontaine Museum of Art has more success than any other museum has ever seen. That is, of course, until he shuts it down.When Laurent?s wife, Marie, is found dead during an exhibition opening at the museum in 1967, the police are quick to determine suicide. Laurent is quick to determine otherwise. He promptly closes his historic building and halts his highly coveted life in the arts to dedicate the next ten years to one thing: finding the person who killed Marie. In 1977, exactly ten years after the tragedy, Laurent invites who he found to be the six most likely suspects back into his museum, breaking his silence for the first time in a decade. With the event disguised as a ?Grand Reopening,? the guests arrive, and Laurent reveals the truth: none of these misfortunate people will be leaving his palace until justice is served. But, Laurent </p>

For some it can be enjoyed only after death; for others, it&#8217;s in our midst&#8211;or just across the ocean&#8211;if only we can find eyes to see it.Traveling from Iran to North Korea, from the Dalai Lama&#8217;s Himalayas to the ghostly temples of Japan, Pico Iyer brings together a lifetime of explorations to upend our ideas of utopia and ask how we might find peace in the midst of difficulty and suffering. Does religion lead us back to Eden or only into constant contention? Why </p>

There, she bravely enrolls herself in high school and </p>

<p>Summary : Veel mensen beschouwen het werk van Hegel (1770-1831) als duister en extreem moeilijk, maar desalniettemin worden het belang en de invloed ervan alom erkend. In dit boek elimineert Peter Singer alle voorwendselen om onwetend te blijven van de hoofdlijnen van Hegels filosofie. Hij biedt een ruimdenkende bespreking van Hegels idee?n en een beschrijving van diens belangrijkste werken. Om Hegels denken toegankelijk te maken, kiest Singer voor een zo vriendelijk mogelijke benadering. Hij begint met het meest concrete deel van Hegels denken: diens filosofie van de ge?schie?denis. Van daaruit gaat de auteur, terwijl hij nog steeds op het sociale en politieke niveau blijft, over naar Hegels opvattingen over vrijheid en de rationele ordening van de maatschappij. Ten slotte bespreekt hij Die Ph?no?me?no?logie des Geistes en de Wissenschaft der Logik.</p>

In the end more of the important stuff gets done and the impact on results is profound.Explains how to leverage the power of a 12 week year to drive improved results in any area of your lifeOffers a how-to book for both individuals and organizations seeking to improve their execution effectivenessAuthors are leading experts on execution and implementationTurn your organization&#8217;s idea of a year on its head, and speed your journey to success.</p>

O combate ocorreu em 991 d.C., em Essex, pr?ximo ?

<p>Summary : When long-time White Rock resident Mike Donnelly is found dead at his hunting camp, it appears as if the tragic death was by his own hand. But a gut feeling tells Chief of Police Sam Mason otherwise. Is it any coincidence that Mike?s family farm sits smack in the middle of a parcel of land that greedy Lucas Thorne desperately needs to complete the development of his resort? Sam and Sergeant Jody Harris?s line of questioning stirs up a hornet?s nest. When Thorne threatens to expose a secret from Sam?s past, Sam realizes the corruption in White Rock runs deeper than he ever suspected. And when a startling discovery surrounding slain officer Tyler Richardson is brought to light, Sam and Jo discover that you never can tell who might be keeping secrets.</p>

<p>Summary : An intimate, revealing memoir from one of the most important activists of our time.While working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq for the United States Army in 2010, Chelsea Manning disclosed more than seven hundred thousand classified military and diplomatic records that she had smuggled out of the country on the memory card of her digital camera. In 2011 she was charged with twenty-two counts related to the unauthorized possession and distribution of classified military records, and in 2013 she was sentenced to thirty-five years in military prison.The day after her conviction, Manning declared her gender identity as a woman and began to transition, seeking hormones through the federal court system. In 2017, President Barack Obama commuted her sentence and she was released from prison.In README .txt, Manning recounts how her pleas for increased institutional transparency and government accountability took place alongside a fight to defend her rights as a trans woman.

<p>Summary : The New York Times bestselling author of Plenty teams up with Ottolenghi Test Kitchen&#8217;s Ixta Belfrage to reveal how flavor is created and amplified through 100+ innovative, super-delicious, plant-based recipes. Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage offer a next-level approach to vegetables that breaks down the fundamentals of cooking into three key elements: process, pairing, and produce. For process, Yotam and Ixta show how easy techniques such as charring and infusing can change the way you think about cooking. Discover how to unlock new depths of flavor by pairing vegetables with sweetness, fat, acidity, or chile heat, and learn to identify the produce that has the innate ability to make dishes shine.With main courses, sides, desserts, and a whole pantry of &#8220;flavor bombs&#8221; (homemade condiments), there&#8217;s something for any meal, any night of the week, including surefire hits such as Stuffed Eggplant in Curry and Coconut Dal, Spicy Mushroom Lasagne, and Romano Pepper Schnitzels.</p>
