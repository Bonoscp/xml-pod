<p>Summary : When Cathy Flaherty&#8217;s teenage son, Mark, is arrested for selling drugs, her neighbors once again show that Cedar Circle is more than a suburban cul-de-sac. It is a tightly knit circle of friends whose faith, love, and encouragement help each other make it through the changing seasons of life. More is at stake for Cathy than her son. With Mark in juvenile detention, the single mother of three finds herself struggling over whether to marry Steve Bennett, a man she truly loves. It will take strength and wisdom for Steve to see Cathy through this time of family conflict. Fortunately, he is not alone. Other lives, each with concerns of their own, weave together in a strong show of mutual care and support. And through the hands and hearts of this loving community, God moves.</p>

<p>Summary : When Cathy Flaherty&#8217;s teenage son, Mark, is arrested for selling drugs, her neighbors once again show that Cedar Circle is more than a suburban cul-de-sac. It is a tightly knit circle of friends whose faith, love, and encouragement help each other make it through the changing seasons of life. More is at stake for Cathy than her son. With Mark in juvenile detention, the single mother of three finds herself struggling over whether to marry Steve Bennett, a man she truly loves. It will take strength and wisdom for Steve to see Cathy through this time of family conflict. Fortunately, he is not alone. Other lives, each with concerns of their own, weave together in a strong show of mutual care and support. And through the hands and hearts of this loving community, God moves.</p>

<p>Summary : O Alquimista relata as aventuras de Santiago, um jovem pastor andaluz que abandona a sua terra natal e viaja pelo Norte de ?frica em busca de uma quimera ? um tesouro enterrado sob as pir?mides. Uma cigana, um homem que diz ser rei e um alquimista ir?o ajud?-lo na sua busca. Ningu?m sabe exatamente o que ? o tesouro nem se Santiago conseguir? ultrapassar todos os obst?culos da sua travessia do deserto. Mas aquilo que come?a por ser uma aventura por locais ex?ticos para procurar a riqueza material, acaba por se transformar numa viagem de descoberta de si mesmo e da riqueza da alma humana. O Alquimista recria um s?mbolo intemporal que nos recorda a import?ncia de seguir os nossos sonhos e de ouvir a voz do cora??o.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Sullivan remains the critic American journalism requires, a veteran practitioner with street cred, still in touch with the ?unaccountable joy? of reporting and writing that continues to draw talented young people to the field.? ?Steve Coll, The New York Times Book ReviewSullivan began her career at the Buffalo News, where she rose from summer intern to editor in chief. In Newsroom Confidential she chronicles her years in the trenches battling sexism and throwing elbows in a highly competitive newsroom. In 2012, Sullivan was appointed the public editor of The New York Times, the first woman to hold that important role. She was in the unique position of acting on behalf of readers to weigh the actions and reporting of the paper&#8217;s staff, parsing potential lapses in judgment, unethical practices, and thorny journalistic issues. Sullivan recounts how she navigated the paper?s controversies, from Hillary Clinton&#8217;s emails to Elon Musk&#8217;s accusations of unfairness to the need for greater </p>

<p>Summary : Elliptic Tales describes the latest developments in number theory by looking at one of the most exciting unsolved problems in contemporary mathematics&#8211;the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture. In this book, Avner Ash and Robert Gross guide readers through the mathematics they need to understand this captivating problem.The key to the conjecture lies in elliptic curves, which may appear simple, but arise from some very deep&#8211;and often very mystifying&#8211;mathematical ideas. Using only basic algebra and calculus while presenting numerous eye-opening examples, Ash and Gross make these ideas accessible to general readers, and, in the process, venture to the very frontiers of modern mathematics.&#8211; &#8220;Mathematics Magazine&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : What if you thought you murdered your best friend? And if everyone else thought so too? And what if the truth doesn&#8217;t matter?After Lucy is found wandering the streets, covered in her best friend Savvy?s blood, everyone thinks she is a murderer. Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It?s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can?t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast &#8220;Listen for the Lie,&#8221; and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy?s murder for the show?s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend?s murder, even if she is the one that did it.</p>

<p>Summary : On the way home from a party, seventeen-year-old Ivy and her soon-to-be ex nearly run over a nude young woman standing in the middle of a tree-lined road. It?s only the first in a string of increasingly eerie events and offerings: a dead rabbit in the driveway, a bizarre concoction buried by her mother in the backyard, a box of childhood keepsakes hidden in her parents? closet safe. Most unsettling of all, corroded recollections of Ivy and her enigmatic mother?s past resurface, with the help of the boy next door.What if there?s more to Ivy?s mother than meets the eye? And what if the supernatural forces she messed with during her own teen years have come back to haunt them both? Ivy must grapple with these questions and more if she?s going to escape the darkness closing in.Straddling Ivy?s contemporary suburban town and her mother?s magic-drenched 1990s Chicago, this bewitching and propulsive story rockets towards a conclusion guaranteed to keep readers up all night.</p>

<p>Summary : Desde el m?s all?, cuenta el suceso que conmociona a todo un pueblo cuando un cient?fico, Crawford Tillinghast, inventa un dispositivo que emite una resonancia que estimula la gl?ndula pineal, pero lo que consigue es crear una m?quina que sirve como puente entre dos universos muy distintos: el nuestro y otro bastante aterrador.H.

<p>Summary : A shield maiden blessed by the gods battles to unite a nation under a power-hungry king?while also fighting her growing desire for his fiery son?in this Norse-inspired fantasy romance from the bestselling author of The Bridge Kingdom series.Bound in an unwanted marriage, Freya spends her days gutting fish, but dreams of becoming a warrior. And of putting an axe in her boorish husband?s back.Freya?s dreams abruptly become reality when her husband betrays her to the region?s jarl, landing her in a fight to the death against his son, Bjorn. To survive, Freya is forced to reveal her deepest secret: She possesses a drop of a goddess?s blood, which makes her a shield maiden with magic capable of repelling any attack. It was foretold such a magic would unite the fractured nation of Skaland beneath the one who controls the shield maiden?s fate.Believing he?s destined to rule Skaland as king, the fanatical jarl binds Freya with a blood oath and orders Bjorn to protect her from their enemies. </p>

<p>Summary : On the night Rune?s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is.Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe ? a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution ? who she can&#8217;t help but find herself falling for.Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune?s merchant ships to smuggle renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He soon realizes </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The brightest star needs the darkest night.&#8221;In a world abandoned by the celestial guardians and left to suffer a tyrant king?s reign, all Astraea knows is safety in seclusion. With fragmented memories of only five years of her life, she?s determined to discover more about her past, even if that means fleeing the cruel arms that hold her safe from the wicked vampires rumored to roam the land.But when Astraea stumbles upon the mysterious Nyte, she soon realizes determination alone isn?t enough to guard her heart.

In her desperation, Astraea accepts Nyte?s help before she can decide if she might have sold her allegiance to one of the bloodthirsty beings the people of her world fear.Once their bargain is struck, Astraea?s chance to escape comes in the form of accompanying her best friend Cassia to the King?s </p>

<p>Summary : A young Heyerdahl spent 1936 with his bride, Liv, on Fatu-Hiva in the Marquesas Islands. They wanted to escape civilization &amp; live strictly according to nature. Without medical supplies, they came within inches of losing their lives, but they also found the serenity they were seeking. They built a bamboo cabin &amp; lived off the land, struggling against myriad diseases. They lived to tell of hazardous inter-island voyages, their idyllic month-long stay with the last surviving Polynesian cannibal, their mixed relations with the islanders, their failures &amp; successes in an entirely natural world. Fatu-Hiva was a turning point in Heyerdahl&#8217;s life. It was there that he began to pick up a trail that would lead to the Kon-Tiki expedition. Ancient stone figures, the presence of such flora as the pineapple &amp; local legends all pointed to an early migration from South America. At the time, this theory was considered outrageous. Heyerdahl would later prove it not only possible, but </p>

<p>Summary : For the first time in one volume, a collection of Shirley Jackson&#8217;s scariest stories, with a foreword by PEN/Hemingway Award winner Ottessa Moshfegh  After the publication of her short story &#8220;The Lottery&#8221; in the New Yorker in 1948 received an unprecedented amount of attention, Shirley Jackson was quickly established as a master horror storyteller. This collection of classic and newly reprinted stories provides readers with more of her unsettling, dark tales, including the &#8220;The Possibility of Evil&#8221; and &#8220;The Summer People.&#8221; In these deliciously dark stories, the daily commute turns into a nightmarish game of hide and seek, the loving wife hides homicidal thoughts and the concerned citizen might just be an infamous serial killer. In the haunting world of Shirley Jackson, nothing is as it seems and nowhere is safe, from the city streets to the crumbling country pile, and from the small-town apartment to the dark, dark woods. There&#8217;s something sinister in suburbia.For more than seventy </p>

<p>Summary : The 19th mystery in the #1 New York Times-bestselling Armand Gamache series.Relentless phone calls interrupt the peace of a warm August morning in Three Pines. Though the tiny Qu?bec village is impossible to find on any map, someone has managed to track down Armand Gamache, head of homicide at the S?ret?, as he sits with his wife in their back garden. Reine-Marie watches with increasing unease as her husband refuses to pick up, though he clearly knows who is on the other end. When he finally answers, his rage shatters the calm of their quiet Sunday morning.That&#8217;s only the first in a sequence of strange events that begin THE GREY WOLF, the nineteenth novel in Louise Penny&#8217;s #1 New York Times-bestselling series. A missing coat, an intruder alarm, a note for Gamache reading &#8220;this might interest you&#8221;, a puzzling scrap of paper with a mysterious list?and then a murder. All propel Chief Inspector Gamache and his team toward a terrible realization. Something much more sinister than any one </p>

<p>Summary : L?idea ? semplice quanto affascinante: se un avvenimento impensabile dovesse annullare la civilt? come la conosciamo oggi, in che modo si potrebbe ripartire da zero per ricostruirla? Inizia da qui un viaggio a ritroso attraverso migliaia di anni di straordinarie invenzioni: dalla ruota al fuoco, dalle cure mediche con le piante alla caldaia a vapore, dal binomio chiave/serratura al tatuaggio, dalla polvere da sparo al sushi. I testi brevi, ma precisi e informati, le illustrazioni (oltre 700) originali e ricchissime di dettagli, la cura nella realizzazione editoriale e soprattutto la scelta degli argomenti, inaspettata e per certi versi geniale, fanno di The Book un unicum nell?editoria odierna.</p>

<p>Summary : L?idea ? semplice quanto affascinante: se un avvenimento impensabile dovesse annullare la civilt? come la conosciamo oggi, in che modo si potrebbe ripartire da zero per ricostruirla? Inizia da qui un viaggio a ritroso attraverso migliaia di anni di straordinarie invenzioni: dalla ruota al fuoco, dalle cure mediche con le piante alla caldaia a vapore, dal binomio chiave/serratura al tatuaggio, dalla polvere da sparo al sushi. I testi brevi, ma precisi e informati, le illustrazioni (oltre 700) originali e ricchissime di dettagli, la cura nella realizzazione editoriale e soprattutto la scelta degli argomenti, inaspettata e per certi versi geniale, fanno di The Book un unicum nell?editoria odierna.</p>

<p>Summary : Funny Girl is a collection of uproarious stories, rollicking comics, rib-tickling wit, and more, from 25 of today&#8217;s funniest female writers for kids. What could be funnier than family? Read stories about Ursula Brown&#8217;s grandmother driving her on a road trip to disaster, Lisa Brown&#8217;s little brother getting a Tic-Tac stuck up his nose, and Carmen Agra Deedy&#8217;s mom setting the bathtub on fire.What could be funnier than friends? Pretty much nothing, as Rita Williams-Garcia shows two besties hatching a bird-brained scheme to get on to a TV talk show, and Deborah Underwood introduces a dynamic dog-and-cat duo teaming up on a pet advice column.What could be funnier than YOU? Tell your future with Mad Libs, discover your Chinese Zodiac sign with Lenore Look, and learn the best tricks of the comedy trade from professional humorists like Adrianne Chalepah and Delaney Yeager.With clever contributions from award-winning and bestselling authors including Cece Bell, Sophie Blackall, Libba Bray, </p>

<p>Summary : Remi Hayes is beginning to think she?s cursed ?her fianc? cheated on her, her brother Jude is a major pain in her ass, and the moldering mansion she inherited from her uncle might just be haunted.Flipping Blackleaf Manor already feels impossible, even before Remi is blackmailed by Dane Covett, the dangerously hot doctor-next-door, and Grimstone?s most eligible bachelor?if you can ignore the fact that everyone in town thinks he murdered his wife.Remi doesn?t want to believe it, especially after Dane sews up a gash in her thigh and steals a kiss in payment?a kiss that makes it hard to walk for reasons that have nothing to do with an injured leg.But as the renovation takes a strange and violent turn, Remi must decide if Dane is the one haunting her nights, or if he?s trying to protect her from something much worse?Lark Notes :Halloween is my favorite! I get such a thrill out of writing a spooky, dark book at this time of year. Remi and Dane are two deeply damaged people with skeletons </p>

<p>Summary : From iconic NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony comes a raw and inspirational memoir about growing up in the housing projects of Red Hook and Baltimore?a brutal world Where Tomorrows Aren?t Promised. NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony candidly opens up about his experiences growing up amidst poverty, racism, mental illness, addiction, and murder. His story challenges America to think about the slim odds of a world-class athlete even surviving such circumstances long enough to be recruited by the NBA?not to mention the trauma and survivor?s guilt he will carry with him forever. Carmelo also shares the small beauties of human experience that helped him stay sane: the power of love, family, community, and education. Anthony?s courageous story of loss and beating impossible odds will resonate with fans universally.</p>

Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures.

<p>Summary : Para Azor?n esta novela resume mejor que ninguna el esp?ritu de Baroja. Y efectivamente: sus principios filos?ficos y sociales, la reacci?n frente a la miseria y el dolor, y los elementos autobiogr?ficos hacen de esta obra muestra privilegiada del mundo del autor. M?dico, como Baroja, el protagonista de El ?rbol de la ciencia asiste impotente a los desafueros de una sociedad mezquina y envilecida. Entre el determinismo fisiol?gico y la rebeli?n moral hay la b?squeda de un camino propio.</p>

<p>Summary : On a remote Outer Banks island, a serial killer collects his prized specimens. And to stop him, an FBI agent must confront his own twisted past.FBI agent Tiberius Granger has seen his share of darkness. But a new case sets him on edge. It?s not just the macabre way both victims?found posed in front of lighthouses?are tattooed with flowers that match their names.

That may prove a mistake, and not just because Ty doesn?t know he?s the father of her teenaged son. It seems the killer is taunting Ty, drawing everyone close to him into deeper danger.As the slashing winds and rain of a deadly hurricane approach the coast of North Carolina, the search leads Ty and Bex to an island that hides a grisly secret. But in his quest for the truth, Ty has ignored </p>
