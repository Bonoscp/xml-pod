<p>Summary : Kenan Thompson is Saturday Night Live&#8217;s longest-ever-serving cast member and a star of such pioneering sketches as &#8220;Black Jeopardy&#8221; and is hugely beloved thanks to a tidal wave of nostalgic fans who grew up on early 2000s classics All That, Good Burger, and Kenan &amp; Kel on Nickelodeon.He&#8217;s also a dad (to two girls) in his mid-40s living in suburbia, and whose universal, relatable, family-friendly humor has created unbelievable appeal and engagement from fans from middle America to coastal elites. Becoming a dad sucked the cool right out of him ? and he&#8217;s OK with that!When I Was Your Age is packed with hilarious yet poignant essays that are aimed to offer any reader valuable advice on parenting, focusing on positivity, and having fun in life. Kids, new parents, fellow fathers, budding comics, and aunties who want to pinch his cheeks, can all learn from his biggest mistakes and most triumphant victories. There&#8217;s something for everybody here!</p>

<p>Summary : From the 2-time Tony Award-winner and the star of TV?s Younger, funny and intimate stories and reflections about how crafting has kept her sane while navigating the highs and lows of family, love, and show business (and how it can help you, too).Whether she?s playing an ?age-defying? book editor on television or dazzling audiences on the Broadway stage, Sutton Foster manages to make it all look easy.

<p>Summary : ?The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it?.When Basil Hallward paints the portrait of young handsome Dorian Gray, he falls prey to his dazzling beauty. Afraid that his youth and looks will waste away, Dorian expresses a wish that his portrait, and not he, will age and fade over time. His wish is granted, and over the ensuing years, Dorian indulges in every kind of vice and pleasure, never aging nor disfiguring. Only his portrait, hidden to the world, bears the marks of his actions, and as his soul grows ever more wasted and corrupted, devastating consequences lie in wait. The Picture of Dorian Gray is an exploration of the purpose of art, the superficial nature of youth and beauty, and the conflict between morality and intemperance. First published in its complete, uncensored form in 1891, it is Oscar Wilde?s only novel.</p>

<p>Summary : It?s curtains for a famous Broadway director, and private investigator Nero Wolfe is on the case?but his assistant, Archie Goodwin, is a suspect. When a renowned theater director senses something amiss during his latest production, he calls in Nero Wolfe. Though the corpulent genius wouldn?t normally accept a job this vague, a mutual friend dangles the prospect of a very rare orchid in exchange for his services, and Wolfe can?t resist. With a mind to suss out useful backstage gossip, Wolfe turns to his faithful assistant, Archie Goodwin, to impersonate a journalist in order to speak to the cast. Though Goodwin?s conversations prove unfruitful, on his last day at the theater, the director is murdered in his soundproof booth, poisoned by an unseen culprit during an evening performance. In short order, an actor whose health is failing attempts suicide with the same poison. Now Goodwin is a prime suspect in the director?s demise, effectively sidelining him for the rest of the case, and </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  I am a Weyward, and wild inside. <br />
2019: Under cover of darkness, Kate flees London for ramshackle Weyward Cottage, inherited from a great aunt she barely remembers. With its tumbling ivy and overgrown garden, the cottage is worlds away from the abusive partner who tormented Kate. But she begins to suspect that her great aunt had a secret. One that lurks in the bones of the cottage, hidden ever since the witch-hunts of the 17th century.1619: Altha is awaiting trial for the murder of a local farmer who was stampeded to death by his herd. As a girl, Altha?s mother taught her their magic, a kind not rooted in spell casting but in a deep knowledge of the natural world. But unusual women have always been deemed dangerous, and as the evidence for witchcraft is set out against Altha, she knows it will take all of her powers to maintain her freedom.1942: As World War II rages, Violet is trapped in her family&#8217;s grand, crumbling estate. Straitjacketed by societal convention, she longs for the </p>

<p>Summary : A disillusioned millennial ghostwriter who, quite literally, has some ghosts of her own, has to find her way back home in this sparkling adult debut from national bestselling author Ashley Poston.Florence Day is the ghostwriter for one of the most prolific romance authors in the industry, and she has a problem?after a terrible breakup, she no longer believes in love. It?s as good as dead. When her new editor, a too-handsome mountain of a man, won?t give her an extension on her book deadline, Florence prepares to kiss her career goodbye. But then she gets a phone call she never wanted to receive, and she must return home for the first time in a decade to help her family bury her beloved father. For ten years, she?s run from the town that never understood her, and even though she misses the sound of a warm Southern night and her eccentric, loving family and their funeral parlor, she can?t bring herself to stay. Even with her father gone, it feels like nothing in this town has changed. </p>

<p>Summary : Nos tempos de Jay Gatsby, o jazz ? a m?sica do momento, a riqueza parece estar em toda parte, o gim ? a bebida nacional (apesar da lei seca) e o sexo se torna uma obsess?o americana. O protagonista deste romance ? um generoso e misterioso anfitri?o que abre a sua luxuosa mans?o ?s festas mais extravagantes. O livro ? narrado pelo aristocrata falido Nick Carraway, que vai para Nova York trabalhar como corretor de t?tulos. Passa a conviver com a prima, Daisy, por quem Gatsby ? apaixonado, o marido dela, Tom Buchanan, e a golfista Jordan Baker, todos integrantes da aristocracia tradicional.Na raiz do drama, como nos outros livros de Fitzgerald, est? o dinheiro. Mas o romantismo obsessivo de Gatsby com rela??o a Daisy se contrap?e ao materialismo do sonho americano, traduzido exclusivamente em riqueza.Aclamado pelos cr?ticos desde a publica??o, em 1925, O grande Gatsby ? a obra-prima de Scott Fitzgerald, ?cone da ?gera??o perdida? e dos expatriados que foram para a Europa nos anos 1920.</p>

<p>Summary : A playful personal and cultural history of travel from a postcolonial, person-of-color perspective, Airplane Mode asks: what does it mean to be a joyous traveler when we live in the ruins of colonialism, capitalism and climate change?For Shahnaz Habib, an Indian Muslim woman, travel has always been a complicated pleasure. Yet, journeys at home and abroad have profoundly shaped her life. In this inquiring and surprising debut, Habib traces a history of travel from pilgrimages to empires to safaris, taking on colonialist modes of thinking about travel and asking who gets to travel and who gets to write about it.Threaded through the book are inviting and playful analyses of obvious and not-so-obvious travel artifacts: passports, carousels, bougainvilleas, guidebooks, expressways, the idea of wanderlust. Together, they tell a subversive history of travel as a Euro-American mode of consumerism?but as any traveler knows, travel is more than that. As an immigrant whose loved ones live </p>

<p>Summary : More than three decades after its first publication, Edward Said&#8217;s groundbreaking critique of the West&#8217;s historical, cultural, and political perceptions of the East has become a modern classic.In this wide-ranging, intellectually vigorous study, Said traces the origins of &#8220;orientalism&#8221; to the centuries-long period during which Europe dominated the Middle and Near East and, from its position of power, defined &#8220;the orient&#8221; simply as &#8220;other than&#8221; the occident. This entrenched view continues to dominate western ideas and, because it does not allow the East to represent itself, prevents true understanding. Essential, and still eye-opening, Orientalism remains one of the most important books written about our divided world.</p>

<p>Summary : Nello sterminato fascio di carte che compongono gli scritti postumi di Schopenhauer si cela un abbozzo di eudemonologia ? ossia l?arte di essere felici. Schopenhauer concep? infatti il disegno di radunare in un manualetto, articolandoli in cinquanta massime, una serie di pensieri che era venuto formulando nel corso del tempo e che insegnano come vivere il pi? felicemente possibile in un mondo in cui ?la felicit? e i piaceri sono soltanto chimere che un?illusione ci mostra in lontananza, mentre la sofferenza e il dolore sono reali e si annunciano immediatamente da s?, senza bisogno dell?illusione e dell?attesa?. Con la lucidit? e il rigore a lui consueti, Schopenhauer giunge alla conclusione che la felicit? di cui si discorre non ? che un eufemismo, giacch? ??vivere felici? pu? significare solo vivere il meno infelici possibile, o, in breve, vivere passabilmente?. Il grande maestro del pessimismo riesce cos? a offrirci una cauta e diffidente guida a una felicit? che per questa volta </p>

<p>Summary : They think they know me, but they have no idea. As a professional Domme, I see men and women come and go. But no one ever sticks around, and I like it that way. I have a secret to protect?at all costs. So when the cocky, handsome, and submissive Clay Bradley weasels his way into my heart, I do the one thing I?ve always excelled at. I push him away?forever. And like a good boy, he listens. But a few months later, during a chance encounter, he shows up again, but this time he isn?t alone. He has the stunning Jade on his arm. And she has a request of her own. She wants me to teach her. I should say no. Training a woman who makes my knees weak is bad enough. But this particular woman is dating the man who still has my heart. It?s a recipe for disaster. Made worse by one simple fact?they know my secret. And they won?t let go. But how can I protect what?s mine if I?m holding onto them too? Jade and Clay are the only ones who truly see me and the only ones who know? I?m so much more than </p>

Il mondo con le sue regole incomprensibili fuori della porta e lui stravaccato su un divano, circondato di cocacola, scatolette di tonno e romanzi horror. Sar? Olivia, che piomba all?improvviso nel bunker con la sua ruvida e cagionevole vitalit?, a far varcare a Lorenzo la linea d?ombra, a fargli gettare la maschera di adolescente difficile per accettare il gioco caotico della vita l? fuori.</p>

<p>Summary : Barricato in cantina per trascorrere di nascosto da tutti la sua settimana bianca, Lorenzo, un quattordicenne introverso e un po? nevrotico, si prepara a vivere il suo sogno solipsistico di felicit?: niente conflitti, niente compagni di scuola, niente commedie e finzioni. Il mondo con le sue regole incomprensibili fuori della porta e lui stravaccato su un divano, circondato di cocacola, scatolette di tonno e romanzi horror. Sar? Olivia, che piomba all?improvviso nel bunker con la sua ruvida e cagionevole vitalit?, a far varcare a Lorenzo la linea d?ombra, a fargli gettare la maschera di adolescente difficile per accettare il gioco caotico della vita l? fuori.</p>

  New York Times <br />
 Bestselling AuthorThe human heart was created with a great capacity to love. But along with that comes a great capacity to feel pain. There is no denying that those who love us, who are closest to us, can wound us the most profoundly. That kind of pain can be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. And it can feel even more impossible to continue loving in the face of it. Yet that is exactly what we are called to do.Sharing his own story of personal pain, pastor and New York Times bestselling author Jentezen Franklin shows us how to find the strength, courage, and motivation to set aside the hurt, see others as God sees them, and reach out in love. Through biblical and modern-day stories, he discusses different types of relational disappointment and heartache, and answers questions such as Why should I trust again? and How can I ever really forgive?The walls we build around our hearts to cut us off from pain are the very walls </p>

<p>Summary : From Golda to Ginsburg, Yentl to Mama Rose, Tallulah to the Queen of Mean, Tovah Feldshuh has always played powerful women who aren&#8217;t afraid to sit at the table with the big boys and rule their world. But offstage, Tovah struggled to fulfill the one role she never auditioned for: Lily Feldshuh&#8217;s only daughter.Growing up in Scarsdale, New York, in the 1950s, Tovah, known then by her given name Terri Sue, lived a life of piano lessons, dance lessons, shopping trips, and white-gloved cultural trips into Manhattan. In awe of her mother&#8217;s meticulous appearance and perfect manners, Tovah spent her childhood striving for Lily&#8217;s approval, only to feel as though she always fell short. Lily&#8217;s own dreams were beside the point; instead, she devoted herself to Tovah&#8217;s father Sidney and her two children.

<p>Summary : Esta novela ha pasado de ser la breve historia de una joven coreana a convertirse en un terremoto que ha sacudido a las mujeres de medio mundo. Kim Ji-young (que lleva el nombre m?s com?n entre las mujeres coreanas nacidas en 1982) es aparentemente una mujer como cualquier otra, con una juventud sin pena ni gloria, siempre a la sombra. Todo se retuerce cuando, de repente, Kim empieza a hablar con las voces de su madre, de una amiga desaparecida, de otras muchas mujeres. Lo que parec?a una broma adquiere el tono de una respuesta, de una insurrecci?n y, para los dem?s, el tono de una enfermedad. Este libro ha sido una embestida para el panorama literario de todos los pa?ses en los que se ha publicado. Bajo su aparente sencillez, hay una sensaci?n de peligro que palpita a lo largo de todas sus p?ginas y que ha abierto una grieta en los est?ndares de la literatura contempor?nea.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;A powerful and penetrating exploration of what separates great companies and great leaders from the rest.&#8221; -Polly LaBarre, coauthor of Mavericks at Work  Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty? In studying the leaders who&#8217;ve had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way-and it&#8217;s the complete opposite of what everyone else does. People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright brothers might have little in common, but they all started with why. Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire.</p>

<p>Summary : Wer war Hanna? Diese Frau, die so oft aus der Rolle fiel, die nacheinander ihre drei Studienfreunde heiratete und drei T?chter bekam, immer mit Gedichten im Kopf, ?ber die sie den Alltag verga?, die ihren Platz suchte zwischen den Erwartungen der Familie an sie und den eigenen Anspr?chen ? und nur selten f?r sich sein konnte? Viele Jahre nach Hannas Tod blickt die j?ngste Tochter zur?ck auf das Leben ihrer Mutter, auf die eigene Kindheit im Rheinland der Siebziger und Achtziger, in der Hanna daf?r sorgt, dass die Tage immer etwas anders sind als ?blich. Ein Leben zwischen B?rgerlichkeit und mit Champagner und Puschkin am Sonntagmorgen im Bett, Besuche nach der Schule in der Institutsbibliothek, wo die Mutter arbeitet und mit versch?chterten Studenten flirtet, Pokern unterm Weihnachtsbaum, abenteuerliche Fahrten in der Ente ? bis sich Hanna entscheidet, die Familie zu verlassen und ihr Leben allein von vorn zu beginnen.Mit gro?er Einf?hlsamkeit und Leichtigkeit erz?hlt Caroline Peters </p>

<p>Summary : Science tells us that babies develop best when they are spoken to, sung to, and read to. Introduce your baby to a world of words and pictures with these 30 classic nursery rhymes from the Mother Goose collection and beyond paired with images of Chloe Giordano?s delightful hand-embroidered illustrations on cloth. Even when they?re tiny, the sound of their parents? voices helps babies make sense of the world and feel comfortable with new people and places. This treasury gives you the opportunity to rediscover just how useful (and calming) these best-loved nursery rhymes are in one, handsome volume. Bond with your baby and help them grow as you recite and sing these timeless rhymes: Hey, Diddle Diddle; Baa, Baa, Black Sheep; This Little Piggy; Hush Little Baby; Hickory, Dickory, Dock; Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star; Little Bo-Peep; Pussy-cat, Pussy-cat; Row, Row, Row Your Boat; The Itsy Bitsy Spider; London Bridge; Mary Had a Little Lamb; One, Two, Buckle My Shoe; Humpty Dumpty; </p>

<p>Summary : Four New York Times bestsellers by a ?remarkable? Pulitzer Prize?winning journalist capture and celebrate America?s passion for sports (The Seattle Times). ? Pulitzer Prize?winning journalist David Halberstam, preeminent chronicler of the American experience, focuses his meticulous narrative gifts on some of Major League Baseball?s most iconic moments, training for the Olympics, and a remarkable profile of hoops legend Michael Jordan. ?Summer of ?49: In this #1 New York Times bestseller, Halberstam brings to stirring life the unforgettable season that cemented baseball as America?s pastime. A nation in transition is gripped by a pennant race for the ages: the Boston Red Sox, led by Ted Williams?s unearthly bat skills, versus the New York Yankees and Joe DiMaggio?s legendary heroics. Every hit on and off the field crackles across the page ?in such an enjoyable, interesting, and informative manner that a reader needn?t be a baseball fan to appreciate the book? (Library Journal). </p>

<p>Summary : The classic samurai novel about the real exploits of the most famous swordsman. Miyamoto Musashi was the child of an era when Japan was emerging from decades of civil strife. Lured to the great Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 by the hope of becoming a samurai-without really knowing what it meant-he regains consciousness after the battle to find himself lying defeated, dazed and wounded among thousands of the dead and dying. On his way home, he commits a rash act, becomes a fugitive and brings life in his own village to a standstill-until he is captured by a weaponless Zen monk. The lovely Otsu, seeing in Musashi her ideal of manliness, frees him from his tortuous punishment, but he is recaptured and imprisoned. During three years of solitary confinement, he delves into the classics of Japan and China. When he is set free again, he rejects the position of samurai and for the next several years pursues his goal relentlessly, looking neither to left nor to right. Ever so slowly it dawns on </p>

<p>Summary : Uma nova temporada de Exy est? come?ando! A derrocada dos Corvos e de Riko Moryama pegou o mundo de surpresa, mas o que acontece agora? E, principalmente, como ficam os sobreviventes daquela guerra? Jean Moreau n?o faz ideia do que fazer quando tudo o que conhece ? tirado de si. Em um retorno ?pico ao universo de Tudo Pelo Jogo, A quadra Raio de Sol traz o que Nora Sakavic faz de melhor: traumas, Exy, amizades e, quem sabe, at? um pouco de romance.A pr?-venda, com tiragem limitada, inclui marcador de p?ginas, p?ster, cards, cart?es postais e display de mesa.Jean Moreau tem poucas certezas na vida:1) Ele ? um Moreau.2) O lugar dele ? em Evermore.3) Ele pertence aos Moryama.4) Os Troianos bonzinhos s?o a equipe mais p? no saco do Exy.Essas s?o verdades que sempre nortearam Jean durante toda a sua vida. Mas, quando o garoto ? praticamente sequestrado do campus da universidade Edgar Allan e vendido a um mestre ainda mais perigoso, Jean ? obrigado a se conformar com uma vida fora do Ninho </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;Christmas was coming.

<p>Summary : Explaining what William McNeill called The Rise of the West has become the central problem in the study of global history. In Guns, Germs, and Steel Jared Diamond presents the biologist&#8217;s answer: geography, demography, and ecological happenstance. Diamond evenhandedly reviews human history on every continent since the Ice Age at a rate that emphasizes only the broadest movements of peoples and ideas. Yet his survey is binocular: one eye has the rather distant vision of the evolutionary biologist, while the other eye&#8211;and his heart&#8211;belongs to the people of New Guinea, where he has done field work for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Summary : The definitive biography of George Michael, offering an expansive look at the troubled life of the legendary singer, songwriter, and pop superstar.George Michael was an extravagantly gifted, openhearted soul singer whose work was both pained and smolderingly erotic. He was a songwriter of true craft and substance, and his music swept the world, starting in the mid-1980s. His fabricated image?that of a hypermacho sex god?loomed large in the pop culture of his day. It also hid?for a time?the secret he fought against revealing: Michael was gay. Soon his obsession with fame would start to backfire. As one of the industry?s most privileged yet tortured men began to self-destruct, the press showed little sympathy. George Michael: A Life explores the compelling story of a superstar whose struggles, as well as his songs, continue to touch fans all over the world.Acclaimed music biographer James Gavin traces Michael?s metamorphosis from the shy and awkward Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou into </p>

<p>Summary : An electrifying debut novel from an ?unusually gifted writer? (Lorrie Moore) about the radical intimacy of physical competitionAn unexpected tragedy at a community pool. A family?s unrelenting expectation of victory. The desire to gain or lose control; to make time speed up or stop; to be frighteningly, undeniably good at something. Each of the eight teenage girl boxers in this blistering debut novel has her own reasons for the sacrifices she has made to come to Reno, Nevada, to compete to be named the best in the country. Through a series of face-offs that are raw, ecstatic, and punctuated by flashes of humor and tenderness, prizewinning writer Rita Bullwinkel animates the competitors? pasts and futures as they summon the emotion, imagination, and force of will required to win.Frenetic, surprising, and strikingly original, Headshot is a portrait of the desire, envy, perfectionism, madness, and sheer physical pleasure that motivates young women to fight?even, and perhaps especially, </p>

<p>Summary : A heartwarming book full of tenderness. &#8211;Library JournalFrom the bestselling author of One Child, the true story of four problem children and one extraordinary teacher.They were all just somebody else&#8217;s kids&#8211;four problem children placed in Torey Hayden&#8217;s class because nobody knew what else to do with them. They were a motley group of children in great pain: a small boy who echoed other people&#8217;s words and repeated weather forecasts; a beautiful seven-year-old girl whose brain was damaged by savage parental beatings; an angry and violent ten-year-old who had watched his stepmother murder his father; a shy twelve-year-old who had been cast out of Catholic school when she became pregnant. But they shared one thing in common: a remarkable teacher who would never stop caring&#8211;and who would share with them the love and understanding they had never known and help them become a family.</p>

<p>Summary : In this audiobook Maria Popova, creator of The Marginalian, presents a celebration of the human search for truth and beauty through the lenses of science and poetry.Poetry and science, as Popova writes in her introduction, &#8220;are instruments for knowing the world more intimately and loving it more deeply.&#8221; In 15 short essays on subjects ranging from the mystery of dark matter and the infinity of pi to the resilience of trees and the intelligence of octopuses, Popova tells the stories of scientific searching and discovery. These stories are interwoven with details from the very real and human lives of scientists?many of them women, many underrecognized?and poets inspired by the same questions and the beauty they reveal. Each essay is paired with a poem reflecting its subject by poets ranging from Emily Dickinson, W. H. Auden, and Edna St. Vincent Millay to Maya Angelou, Diane Ackerman, and Tracy K. Smith. Together, they wake us to a &#8220;reality aglow with wonder.&#8221;Listening Length: 1 hour </p>

<p>Summary : In this audiobook Maria Popova, creator of The Marginalian, presents a celebration of the human search for truth and beauty through the lenses of science and poetry.Poetry and science, as Popova writes in her introduction, &#8220;are instruments for knowing the world more intimately and loving it more deeply.&#8221; In 15 short essays on subjects ranging from the mystery of dark matter and the infinity of pi to the resilience of trees and the intelligence of octopuses, Popova tells the stories of scientific searching and discovery. These stories are interwoven with details from the very real and human lives of scientists?many of them women, many underrecognized?and poets inspired by the same questions and the beauty they reveal. Each essay is paired with a poem reflecting its subject by poets ranging from Emily Dickinson, W. H. Auden, and Edna St. Vincent Millay to Maya Angelou, Diane Ackerman, and Tracy K. Smith. Together, they wake us to a &#8220;reality aglow with wonder.&#8221;Listening Length: 1 hour </p>
