<p>Summary : From the New York Times bestselling and award-winning author of A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE, a re-examination of one of the 20th century?s greatest unsung power players When Pamela Churchill Harriman died in 1997, obituaries that followed were predictably sexist. Written off as a party girl, courtesan and social climber, her real legacy was overshadowed by a glamorous social life spent in glittering, elite circles of power. That is, until with a wealth of new research, interviews and newly discovered sources, Sonia Purnell is reclaiming her larger-than-life story of influence and power in full, spectacular depth for the first time. At age 20 Churchill?s beloved daughter-in-law became a ?secret weapon? during World War II, wining, dining, and seducing diplomats and envoys to help win over American sentiment (and secrets) for the cause. She transformed Gianni Agnelli into a savvy businessman and heir to the Fiat empire, and after moving to the US brought a struggling Democratic party back </p>

<p>Summary : Mi chiamo Pietro Gerber ma qui a Firenze, dove vivo da quando sono nato, tutti mi conoscono come l?addormentatore di bambini. Sono un ipnotista, come lo era mio padre, e con l?ipnosi aiuto i bambini a elaborare traumi e a superare paure e fobie.Non sembrerebbe, ma il mio ? un mestiere pericoloso. Perch? la mente dei bambini ? un labirinto ed ? facile smarrirsi e non riuscire pi? a tornare.Forse ? proprio questo che sta succedendo a Matias. Ha nove anni e da tempo ha un sogno ricorrente. Da troppo tempo.Ormai Matias ha paura di addormentarsi, perch? in sogno gli fa visita qualcuno che non dovrebbe esistere. Una donna dall?aria triste e vestita sempre di scuro e che non parla mai.La signora silenziosa abita i suoi sogni come uno spettro, come una presenza inquietante che tracima nella realt?.

<p>Summary : Mi chiamo Pietro Gerber ma qui a Firenze, dove vivo da quando sono nato, tutti mi conoscono come l?addormentatore di bambini. Sono un ipnotista, come lo era mio padre, e con l?ipnosi aiuto i bambini a elaborare traumi e a superare paure e fobie.Non sembrerebbe, ma il mio ? un mestiere pericoloso. Perch? la mente dei bambini ? un labirinto ed ? facile smarrirsi e non riuscire pi? a tornare.Forse ? proprio questo che sta succedendo a Matias. Ha nove anni e da tempo ha un sogno ricorrente. Da troppo tempo.Ormai Matias ha paura di addormentarsi, perch? in sogno gli fa visita qualcuno che non dovrebbe esistere. Una donna dall?aria triste e vestita sempre di scuro e che non parla mai.La signora silenziosa abita i suoi sogni come uno spettro, come una presenza inquietante che tracima nella realt?. Non dovrebbe essere nient?altro che un sogno, ma allora?Allora perch? sento che la signora silenziosa ? reale? Allora perch? sento nel silenzio il ronzio di un immenso sciame di insetti? Allora </p>

<p>Summary : 1x basisrecept en 60x variatieDe minimini&#8217;s van Petit G?teau zijn echte eye candy, te proeven in oneindig veel verschillende smaken en kleuren.De basis van deze kleine taartjes is altijd dezelfde, een heerlijk knapperige, boterige bodem van p?te sabl?e. Met de vulling kun je alle kanten op.Ontdek met Kleine Taartjes hoe simpel je thuis met een eenvoudige basis van zanddeeg eindeloos veel verschillende taartjes kunt maken. Bijvoorbeeld met vulling van amandel-, pistache- or zelfs clafoutis-cr?me, daarop gepocheerde peer of lemon curd een een wolkerige meringue of crispy crumble on top.H?t boek voor alle bakkers, beginners en gevorderden, die alles willen weten over vari?ren, vullen en docoreren.Petit G?teau is de enige ?cht Franse patisserie in Amsterdam van Meike Schaling en Patrice Andrieu. Het stel ontmoette elkaar in Parijs waar Meike naar haar patissier-opleiding een eerste patisserie opende. In Amsterdam hebben ze inmiddels twee winkels.</p>

<p>Summary : Als sich am Morgen des Heiligen Abends die G?ste in der Villa des ehemaligen Schokoladenfabrikanten versammeln, ist ihnen klar, dass es keine normale Familienzusammenkunft werden wird. Denn ihr Gastgeber, der wohlhabende Patriarch Arthur von Kempendorf, hatte sich seit einem ungekl?rten Vorfall vor vielen Jahren komplett aus dem gesellschaftlichen Leben zur?ckgezogen. Seine weitverzweigte Verwandtschaft aber, spekulierend auf ein m?gliches Erbe, findet sich mit erstaunlicher Bereitschaft in der etwas verwitterten Villa am Waldrand ein. Doch anstatt einer lukrativen Erbschaft erwartet die Besucher eine Reihe unheimlicher R?tsel, die eins ums andere dunkle Familiengeheimnisse preisgeben. Als dann noch ein blutiges Verbrechen geschieht, w?nschen sich die G?ste nichts sehnlicher, als den Nachhauseweg anzutreten. K?nnen sie aus der d?steren Villa entkommen, bevor sie f?r alle zur t?dlichen Falle wird?24 R?tsel ? 24 T?ren ? und nur ein Ausweg! Der neue Adventsthriller f?r alle R?tselfans </p>

<p>Summary : La famiglia Kito ha buttato Momo, Okarun e Jiji in un mondo sotterraneo che si estende sotto la casa di quest?ultimo per offrirli al Grande Serpente.

Prima di affrontarlo, Okarun riesce a riportare Momo in superficie, dove la ragazza escogita un ottimo piano per eliminare il Grande Serpente.

<p>Summary : Born in rural Mexico, Eduardo ?Lalo? Garc?a and his family left for the United States when he was a child, picking fruits and vegetables from Florida to Michigan. He worked in Atlanta restaurants as a teenager, before being convicted of a robbery, incarcerated, and eventually deported. Lalo landed in Mexico City as a new generation of chefs were questioning the hierarchies that had historically privileged European cuisine in elite spaces. At his acclaimed restaurant, M?ximo Bistrot, Lalo began to craft transcendent food that narrated his memories and hopes.Journalist Laura Tillman spent five years immersively reporting on Lalo?s story. What emerges is a moving portrait of his struggle to find authenticity in an industry built on the very inequalities that drove his family to leave home. Deeply researched and intimately told,?The Migrant Chef offers readers an unforgettable window into the immigrant experience, Mexico?s culinary heritage, and the making of a chef.</p>

<p>Summary : Born in rural Mexico, Eduardo ?Lalo? Garc?a and his family left for the United States when he was a child, picking fruits and vegetables from Florida to Michigan. He worked in Atlanta restaurants as a teenager, before being convicted of a robbery, incarcerated, and eventually deported. Lalo landed in Mexico City as a new generation of chefs were questioning the hierarchies that had historically privileged European cuisine in elite spaces. At his acclaimed restaurant, M?ximo Bistrot, Lalo began to craft transcendent food that narrated his memories and hopes.Journalist Laura Tillman spent five years immersively reporting on Lalo?s story. What emerges is a moving portrait of his struggle to find authenticity in an industry built on the very inequalities that drove his family to leave home. Deeply researched and intimately told,?The Migrant Chef offers readers an unforgettable window into the immigrant experience, Mexico?s culinary heritage, and the making of a chef.</p>

<p>Summary : Melody faces her fears to follow her passion in this sequel to Out of My Mind.Melody is a year older, and a year braver. And now with her Medi-talker, she feels nothing?s out of her reach, not even summer camp. There have to be camps for differently-abled kids like her, and she?s going to sleuth one out. A place where she can trek through a forest, fly on a zip line, and even ride on a horse! A place where maybe she really can finally make a real friend, make her own decisions, and even do things on her own?the dream!  By the light of flickering campfires and the power of thunderstorms, through the terror of unexpected creatures in cabins and the first sparkle of a crush, Melody?s about to discover how brave and strong she really is.</p>

<p>Summary : Recuerda? nunca hagas un trato con un Destino.Evangeline Fox se cri? en la tienda de curiosidades de su amado padre, donde creci? con leyendas sobre inmortales, como el tr?gico Pr?ncipe de Corazones. Sabe que sus poderes son m?ticos, que vale la pena morir por su beso y que los tratos con ?l rara vez terminan bien. Pero cuando Evangeline se entera de que el amor de su vida est? a punto de casarse con otra, se desespera lo suficiente como para ofrecerle al Pr?ncipe de Corazones lo que quiera a cambio de su ayuda para detener la boda. El pr?ncipe solo pide tres besos. Pero despu?s del primer beso prometido de Evangeline, se entera de que el Pr?ncipe de Corazones quiere mucho m?s de ella de lo que ha prometido. Y tiene planes para Evangeline que terminar?n en la mayor felicidad para siempre, o en la tragedia m?s exquisita?</p>

<p>Summary : Would you risk everything for the man you loved? Even if you knew he&#8217;d done something terrible?Lara?s life looks perfect on the surface. Gorgeous doting husband Massimo, sweet little son Sandro and the perfect home. Lara knows something about Massimo. Something she can?t tell anyone else or everything Massimo has worked so hard for will be destroyed: his job, their reputation, their son. This secret is keeping Lara a prisoner in her marriage. Maggie is married to Massimo?s brother Nico and lives with him and her troubled step-daughter. She knows all of Nico?s darkest secrets ? or so she thinks. Then one day she discovers a letter in the attic which reveals a shocking secret about Nico?s first wife Caitlin. Will Maggie set the record straight or keep silent to protect those she loves? For a family held together by lies, the truth will come at a devastating price. A heart-wrenching, emotionally gripping read for fans of Amanda Prowse, Liane Moriarty, and Diane Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Summary : Alternate-Cover Edition for this ISBN can be found hereJ.R.R. Tolkien is best known for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings but those who thought these two wonderful adventures marked the height of his imagination have many more delights to come. The Silmarillion represents the source of Tolkien&#8217;s later work and follows the events of the First Age of Middle Earth. For information, The Lord of the Rings concerns the end of the Third Age.The Silmarillion is a gloriously realised story of rebellion, exile, war and the heroism of elves and men. But to gain an insight into the staggering complexity of Tolkien&#8217;s world, however, the shorter works also included are must-reads. Dealing with the myth of creation, the nature of the Gods, the fall of N?menor and the Rings of Power, they paint a vivid picture not only of Middle Earth but also of the author&#8217;s soaring imagination.Tolkien was born of English parents in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 1892 and died in England in 1973. He worked on </p>

Even before its usage to mean a female canine, bitch didn?t refer to gender at all?it originated as a gender-neutral word meaning genitalia.

<p>Summary : The word &#8220;bitch&#8221; conjures many images for many people, but is most often meant to describe an unpleasant woman. Even before its usage to mean a female canine, bitch didn?t refer to gender at all?it originated as a gender-neutral word meaning genitalia. A perfectly innocuous word devolving into a female insult is the case for tons more terms, including hussy, which simply meant ?housewife,? or slut, which meant ?untidy? and was also used to describe men. These words are just a few among history?s many English slurs hurled at women.?Amanda Montell, feminist linguist and staff features editor at online beauty and health magazine Byrdie.com, deconstructs language?from insults and cursing to grammar and pronunciation patterns?to reveal the ways it has been used for centuries to keep women form gaining equality. Ever wonder why so many people are annoyed when women use the word ?like? as a filler? Or why certain gender neutral terms stick and others don?t? Or even how linguists have </p>

<p>Summary : A landmark biography that reclaims Ella Fitzgerald as a major American artist and modernist innovator. Ella Fitzgerald (1917?1996) possessed one of the twentieth century?s most astonishing voices. In this first major biography since Fitzgerald?s death, historian Judith Tick offers a sublime portrait of this ambitious risk-taker whose exceptional musical spontaneity made her a transformational artist.Becoming Ella Fitzgerald clears up long-enduring mysteries. Archival research and in-depth family interviews shed new light on the singer?s difficult childhood in Yonkers, New York, the tragic death of her mother, and the year she spent in a girls? reformatory school?where she sang in its renowned choir and dreamed of being a dancer. Rarely seen profiles from the Black press offer precious glimpses of Fitzgerald?s tense experiences of racial discrimination and her struggles with constricting models of Black and white femininity at midcentury.Tick?s compelling narrative depicts </p>

<p>Summary : In 1845, the American Transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau went to live in the woods near his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts. For over two years he resided there largely in solitary, in a small cabin built by his own hands. Walden is his personal account of this time, in which he documents both his passion for the landscape and wildlife of Walden Pond, and his philosophical and political motivations for rejecting the materialism which continues to define not only America, but much of the modern world.</p>

<p>Summary : Leah MacKenzie, de 17 anos, n?o tem cora??o. O que a mant?m viva ? um cora??o artificial que ela carrega dentro de uma mochila. Com seu tipo sangu?neo raro, um transplante ? como um sonho distante. Conformada, ela tenta se esquecer de que est? com os dias contados, criando uma lista de ?coisas para fazer antes de morrer?. De repente, Leah recebe uma segunda chance: h? um cora??o dispon?vel! O problema ? quando ela descobre que o doador ? um garoto da sua escola ? e que supostamente se matou! Matt, o irm?o g?meo do doador, se recusa a acreditar que Eric se suicidou. Quando Leah o procura, eles descobrem que ambos t?m sonhos semelhantes que podem ter pistas do que realmente aconteceu a Eric. Enquanto tentam desvendar esse mist?rio, Matt e Leah se apaixonam e n?o querem correr o risco de perder um ao outro. Mas nem a vida nem um cora??o transplantado vem com garantias. Quem diria que viver exige mais coragem do que morrer?</p>

<p>Summary : The viral TikTok stalker dark romance, burning with high heat, hilarious banter, and a love story like you?ve never seen before. Can you handle the ride? <br />
  I want someone with a soul as black as night. Someone who would burn the world down for me and not lose a single minute of sleep over it. <br />
Trauma nurse Alyssa Cappellucci doesn?t need any more kinks. She likes the one she?s landed on just fine. To her, nothing could top the masked men she follows online. Unless one of those men was shirtless, heavily tattooed, and waiting for her in her bedroom. She dreams about being hunted by one in particular, of him chasing her down and doing deliciously dark things to her willing body. She never could have guessed that by sending one drunken text, those dreams would become her new reality. <br />
  I want things most people don?t, craving darkness and depravity instead of light and love. <br />

<p>Summary : A groundbreaking, freshly-researched examination of one of the most dramatic and consequential marriages in history: Henry VIII&#8217;s long courtship, short union, and brutal execution of Anne Boleyn.Hunting the Falcon is the story of how Henry VIII&#8217;s obsessive desire for Anne Boleyn changed him and his country forever. John Guy and Julia Fox, two of the most acclaimed and distinguished historians of this period, have joined forces to present Anne and Henry in startlingly new ways. By closely examining the most recent archival discoveries, and peeling back layers of historical myth and misinterpretation and distortion, Guy and Fox are able to set Anne and Henry&#8217;s tragic relationship against the major international events of the time, and integrate and reinterpret sources hidden in plain sight or simply misunderstood. Among other things, they dispel lingering and latently misogynistic assumptions about Anne which anachronistically presumed that a sixteenth-century woman, even a queen, </p>

<p>Summary : The long-awaited memoir from the beloved film and television star?known to multiple generations for his starring roles on the long-running shows Magnum, P.I. and Blue Bloods?chronicles both his life in show business and his life away from it.Nearly every American knows Tom Selleck, both by name and by face. For four decades and counting, Selleck has been a television and film icon, first as Magnum, P.I., one of the most popular and enduring shows of the eighties, and currently in Blue Bloods, where he plays New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan.But Selleck?s career is longer, and richer, than those two hits suggest. He began in the trenches as a working actor in the late sixties and struggled for more than a decade before breaking out with Magnum. At the height of his stardom, he opted not for cookie-cutter blockbusters but for more interesting character-based projects: comedies like Three Men and a Baby and In &amp; Out, a record-setting trilogy of TV-movie Westerns, and </p>

<p>Summary : Ci sembra di sapere tutto della storia di Circe, la maga raccontata da Omero, che ama Odisseo e trasforma i suoi compagni in maiali. Eppure esistono un prima e un dopo nella vita di questa figura, che ne fanno uno dei personaggi femminili pi? fascinosi e complessi della tradizione classica. Circe ? figlia di Elios, dio del sole, e della ninfa Perseide, ma ? tanto diversa dai genitori e dai fratelli divini: ha un aspetto fosco, un carattere difficile, un temperamento indipendente; ? perfino sensibile al dolore del mondo e preferisce la compagnia dei mortali a quella degli d?i. Quando, a causa di queste sue eccentricit?, finisce esiliata sull?isola di Eea, non si perde d?animo, studia le virt? delle piante, impara a addomesticare le bestie selvatiche, affina le arti magiche. Ma Circe ? soprattutto una donna di passioni: amore, amicizia, rivalit?, paura, rabbia, nostalgia accompagnano gli incontri che le riserva il destino ? con l?ingegnoso Dedalo, con il mostruoso Minotauro, con la </p>

<p>Summary : As the world becomes more perilous and our modern ways of life prove to be at times unsustainable or unsatisfying; people in the US and all over the world are increasingly turning to the wisdom of our indigenous people and their traditions for peace, harmony, environmental stewardship, and cultivating a more meaningful spiritual connection to the earth. The Bear Is My Father is a legacy book that shares the profound medicine of a renowned multi-tribal Muscogee Creek medicine man, Bear Heart, one of the last traditionally trained medicine persons of the Muscogee Creek Nation. While it is traditional among Native American medicine that a healer takes on an apprentice to learn their medicine ways, and then pass them on, Bear Heart&#8217;s medicine was so various that it could not simply be passed along to any one person. Thus, over the course of his life of service, Bear Heart passed along pieces of his indigenous wisdom to different people, depending on who could use it. However, The Bear Is </p>

From the challenge of primary battles in a nation that had never elected a Catholic president, to the intense machinations of the national conventions?where JFK chose Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate over the impassioned objections of his brother Bobby?this is a nonfiction political thriller filled with intrigue, cinematic action, and fresh reporting.

<p>Summary : From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and Fox News Channel&#8217;s Chief Political Correspondent, a blockbuster new biography of George Washington, centering on his return from retirement to lead the Constitutional Convention and secure the future of the United States.George Washington rescued the nation and the Constitution three times: first by winning the Revolutionary War, second by presiding over the Constitutional Convention and ushering the Constitution through a fractious ratification process, and third by leading the nation as president in its first years. There is no doubt that the struggling new nation needed to be rescued.After the victorious war, when a spirit of unity and patriotism might have been expected, instead the nation was broken. The states were no more than a loosely knit and contentious confederation, with no strong central union. They were in constant conflict. A frustrated Washington wrote to James Madison, &#8220;We are either a united people, or we are not&#8230; </p>

<p>Summary : From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and Fox News Channel&#8217;s Chief Political Correspondent, a blockbuster new biography of George Washington, centering on his return from retirement to lead the Constitutional Convention and secure the future of the United States.George Washington rescued the nation and the Constitution three times: first by winning the Revolutionary War, second by presiding over the Constitutional Convention and ushering the Constitution through a fractious ratification process, and third by leading the nation as president in its first years. There is no doubt that the struggling new nation needed to be rescued.After the victorious war, when a spirit of unity and patriotism might have been expected, instead the nation was broken. The states were no more than a loosely knit and contentious confederation, with no strong central union. They were in constant conflict. A frustrated Washington wrote to James Madison, &#8220;We are either a united people, or we are not&#8230; </p>

<p>Summary : Winning isn&#8217;t everything in the game of basketball, but who wants to come in second? It takes dedication and discipline to be the best, and the Shohoku High hoops team wants to be just that. They have one year left to make their captain&#8217;s dream of reaching the finals come true?will they do it? Takehiko Inoue&#8217;s legendary basketball manga is finally here, and the tale of a lifetime is in your hands!As luck would have it, the basketball team narrowly avoids suspension over the all-out-brawl incident when Yohei and Mitsui&#8217;s friends take responsibility. Now, with Mitsui back in the lineup for the first time in two years, Shohoku quickly resumes practice in preparation for their upcoming tournament. As punishment for the lack of discipline they displayed in the fight, though, Coach Anzai decides on a starting lineup for Shohoku&#8217;s game without Hanamichi, Rukawa, Ryota and Mitsui. Can Anzai&#8217;s squad hold their own when their best players (and perpetual problem children) ride the bench?</p>

<p>Summary : As a young Florentine envoy to the courts of France and the Italian principalities, Niccol? Machiavelli (1469?1527) was able to observe firsthand the lives of people strongly united under one powerful ruler. His fascination with that political rarity and his intense desire to see the Medici family assume a similar role in Italy provided the foundation for his &#8220;primer for princes.&#8221; In this classic guide to acquiring and maintaining political power, Machiavelli used a rational approach to advise prospective rulers, developing logical arguments and alternatives for a number of potential problems, among them governing hereditary monarchies, dealing with colonies and the treatment of conquered peoples.Refreshing in its directness, yet often disturbing in its cold practicality, The Prince sets down a frighteningly pragmatic formula for political fortune. Starkly relevant to the political upheavals of the 20th century, this calculating prescription for power remains today, nearly 500 years </p>

<p>Summary : To live and dream is a wicked dance.My dreams often come true &#8212; a curse, and a blessing.Pamela Anderson&#8217;s blond bombshell image was ubiquitous in the 1990s. Discovered in the stands during a Canadian football game, she was quickly launched into superstardom, becoming Playboy&#8217;s favorite cover girl and an emblem of Hollywood glamour and sex appeal. Yet the Pamela Anderson we think we know was created through happenstance rather than careful cultivation. Love, Pamela brings forth her true story: that of a small-town girl getting tangled up in her own dream.Growing up on Vancouver Island, the daughter of young, wild, and unwittingly stylish parents, Pamela lived a hardscrabble childhood but developed a deep love for nature, populating her world with misfits, apparitional friends, and injured animals. Eventually overcoming her natural shyness, Pamela&#8217;s restless imagination propelled her into a life few can dream of, from the beaches of Malibu to the coveted scene at the Playboy Mansion. </p>

<p>Summary : Five Views on the Exodus looks at competing views on the historicity, chronology, and theological implications of the exodus. The biblical account of the Israelite exodus from Egypt is one of the most enduring narratives ever told and is a foundational event for several world religions. It resonates across cultures with its timeless themes of redemption and deliverance. It is also the only explanation the Bible gives for Israel&#8217;s origin.Despite its unique legacy, many scholars regard the exodus as fictitious or a cultural memory that may not be a historical event. Even among those who believe the exodus happened, there is no consensus regarding its date. Five Views on the Exodus brings together experts in the fields of biblical studies, Egyptology, and archaeology to discuss and debate the most vexing questions about the exodus. Each offers their own view and offer constructive responses to other leading views on the exodus.The five views presented here include:Early Date: The Exodus </p>

From private villas to mass social housing projects, his radical ideas, designs, and writings presented a whole-scale reinvention not only of individual structures, but of entireconcepts of modern living.Le Corbusier&#8217;s work made distinct developments over the years, from early vernacular houses in Switzerland through dazzling white, purist villas to dynamic syntheses of art and architecture such as the chapel atRonchampand the civic buildings inChandigarh, India.

<p>Summary : The debut poetry collection from Lyndsay Rush (aka @maryoliversdrunkcousin) is a humorous and joyful celebration of big feelings, tender truths, and hard-won wisdom, for fans of Maggie Smith, Kate Baer, and Kate Kennedy.At long last, a book of poetry for people who didn?t even know they liked poetry. And they?re in good company: author Lyndsay Rush didn?t know she liked it either. That is, until she embarked on an internet experiment under the Instagram username @MaryOliversDrunkCousin that turned into a body of work that struck a chord with women across the country; thanks to her signature wordplay, witticisms, and?against all odds?wisdom.With titles like &#8220;Shedonism&#8221;, &#8220;Someone to Eat Chips With&#8221;, &#8220;It?s Called Maximalism, Babe&#8221;, and &#8220;Breaking News: Local Women Gets Out of Bed&#8221;, Rush?s debut collection of poetry uses humor to grapple with the female experience?from questioning whether or not to have children, to roasting the patriarchy, to challenging what it means to &#8220;age </p>

<p>Summary : The debut poetry collection from Lyndsay Rush (aka @maryoliversdrunkcousin) is a humorous and joyful celebration of big feelings, tender truths, and hard-won wisdom, for fans of Maggie Smith, Kate Baer, and Kate Kennedy.At long last, a book of poetry for people who didn?t even know they liked poetry. And they?re in good company: author Lyndsay Rush didn?t know she liked it either. That is, until she embarked on an internet experiment under the Instagram username @MaryOliversDrunkCousin that turned into a body of work that struck a chord with women across the country; thanks to her signature wordplay, witticisms, and?against all odds?wisdom.With titles like &#8220;Shedonism&#8221;, &#8220;Someone to Eat Chips With&#8221;, &#8220;It?s Called Maximalism, Babe&#8221;, and &#8220;Breaking News: Local Women Gets Out of Bed&#8221;, Rush?s debut collection of poetry uses humor to grapple with the female experience?from questioning whether or not to have children, to roasting the patriarchy, to challenging what it means to &#8220;age </p>

Around her, she sees a kingdom fighting for survival, and in Aren, a man fiercely protective of his people. As her mission drives her to deeper understanding of the fight to possess the </p>

<p>Summary : Para trinta e cinco garotas, a Sele??o ? a chance de uma vida. ? a oportunidade de ser al?ada a um mundo de vestidos deslumbrantes e joias valiosas. De morar em um pal?cio, conquistar o cora??o do belo pr?ncipe Maxon e um dia ser a rainha.Para America Singer, no entanto, estar entre as Selecionadas ? um pesadelo. Significa deixar para tr?s o rapaz que ama. Abandonar sua fam?lia e seu lar para entrar em uma disputa ferrenha por uma coroa que ela n?o quer.
