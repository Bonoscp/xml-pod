<p>Summary : <br />
  Book One in the Laidlaw Trilogy <br />
?Laidlaw&#8230;?is not just an inspector of crime; he?s an inspector of society.???Allan Massie, ?The Father of ?Tartan Noir?,? Wall Street Journal Introducing Jack Laidlaw, the original damaged detective.The Laidlaw novels, a groundbreaking trilogy that changed the face of Scottish fiction, are credited with being the founding books of the Tartan Noir movement that includes authors like Val McDermid, Denise Mina, and Ian Rankin. Says McDermid of William McIlvanney: &#8220;Patricia Highsmith had taken us inside the head of killers; Ruth Rendell tentatively explored sexuality; with No Mean City, Alexander McArthur had exposed Glasgow to the world; Raymond Chandler had dressed the darkness in clever words. But nobody had ever smashed those elements together into so accomplished a synthesis.&#8221;In Laidlaw, the first book of the seies, readers meet Jack Laidlaw, a hard-drinking philosopher-detective whose tough exterior cloaks a rich humanity and keen intelligence. </p>

<p>Summary : A dazzling history of the modest family which rose to become one of the most powerful in Europe, The Medici is a remarkably modern story of power, money and ambition. Against the background of an age which saw the rebirth of ancient and classical learning Paul Strathern explores the intensely dramatic rise and fall of the Medici family in Florence, as well as the Italian Renaissance which they did so much to sponsor and encourage.Strathern also follows the lives of many of the great Renaissance artists with whom the Medici had dealings, including Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello; as well as scientists like Galileo and Pico della Mirandola; and the fortunes of those members of the Medici family who achieved success away from Florence, including the two Medici popes and Catherine de&#8217; M?dicis, who became Queen of France and played a major role in that country through three turbulent reigns.</p>

<p>Summary : An eloquent, restless, and enlightening memoir by one of the most thought-provoking journalists today about growing up Black and queer in America, reuniting with the past, and coming of age their own way.One of nineteen children in a blended family, Hari Ziyad was raised by a Hindu Hare K???a mother and a Muslim father. Through reframing their own coming-of-age story, Ziyad takes readers on a powerful journey of growing up queer and Black in Cleveland, Ohio, and of navigating the equally complex path toward finding their true self in New York City. Exploring childhood, gender, race, and the trust that is built, broken, and repaired through generations, Ziyad investigates what it means to live beyond the limited narratives Black children are given and challenges the irreconcilable binaries that restrict them.Heartwarming and heart-wrenching, radical and reflective, Hari Ziyad?s vital memoir is for the outcast, the unheard, the unborn, and the dead. It offers us a new way to think </p>

<p>Summary : A darkly funny and provocative debut novel that reimagines classic fairy tale characters as modern women in a PTSD support group?In present-day New York City, Ruby (Little Red Riding Hood), Gretel, Bernice (Bluebeard?s widow), Marlena (the miller?s daughter from Rumplestiltskin), and Ashlee (the winner of a Love Island-esque dating show, a new kind of fairy tale heroine) all meet in a basement support group to process their traumas.?Though they start out wary of one another, judging each other?s stories, gradually these women begin to realize that they may have more in common than they supposed?What brought them here? What will they reveal? And is it too late for them to rescue each other? ??Dark, edgy, and wickedly funny, this debut for readers of Carmen Maria Machado, Kristen Arnett, and Kelly Link takes our coziest, most beloved childhood stories, exposes them as anti-feminist nightmares, and transforms them into a new kind of myth for grown-up women.</p>

<p>Summary : Kira Nav?rez dreamed of life on new worlds. Now she&#8217;s awakened a nightmare. During a routine survey mission on an uncolonized planet, Kira finds an alien relic. At first she&#8217;s delighted, but elation turns to terror when the ancient dust around her begins to move.As war erupts among the stars, Kira is launched into a galaxy-spanning odyssey of discovery and transformation. First contact isn&#8217;t at all what she imagined, and events push her to the very limits of what it means to be human. While Kira faces her own horrors, Earth and its colonies stand upon the brink of annihilation. Now, Kira might be humanity&#8217;s greatest and final hope&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : In this prequel to EON, Greg Bear continues to explore the possibilities presented by the asteroid Thistledown, a remnant of a lost human civilization. The Way is a tunnel through space and time that leads to other worlds, some more like planet Earth than Earth itself. It is perhaps the most formidable discovery in Thistledown and with it come disputes as to the nature of the Way and how it should be used. The Way can be reached only through Axis City, the only space station of Thistledown. The ruling body of Axis City, the Hexamon, has decreed that other worlds reached by The Way must be left untouched as an insurance against future needs of the human race. But then the Hexamon hear of a group of clandestine colonists who have settled on one of the new worlds. Olmy Ap Sennon is an eager young career soldier who must go and investigate this illegal colony, and at the same time confront his own humanity. As he witnesses the hardship and beauty of the outlaw human colony, he learns </p>

<p>Summary : A work of striking originality bursting with unexpected insights, The Human Condition is a in many respects more relevant now than when it first appeared in 1958. In her study of the state of modern humanity, Hannah Arendt considers humankind from the perspective of the actions of which it is capable. The problems Arendt identified then&#8211;diminishing human agency and political freedom; the paradox that as human powers increase through technological and humanistic inquiry, we are less equipped to control the consequences of our actions?continue to confront us today.</p>

<p>Summary : The use of complex graphs in case interviews has exploded. You have a very short time to look at the graph, analyze it, extract what s important and apply it to your answer. This book was designed to help you understand the role of graphs in consulting (both during an interview and on the job). The authors introduce the Ivy Graph Framework, which will allow you to analyze 11 of the most popular graphs quickly, completely, and with great confidence. In addition the book provides ten sophisticated cases with numerous graphs per case and allows you to see how these cases unfold. There is nothing else out there like it!</p>

<p>Summary : King Midas made me the woman I am today. Notorious. Unattainable. His.The thing about being confined is that you believe it?s to keep the bad out&#8230; Until you realize it?s about keeping you in.I?m now in a strange kingdom surrounded by liars, with no allies of my own, but I won?t sit idly by and let myself wither. No, there?s something that?s bloomed from the pit of my repression. Something dark. Something angry.But the last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.He?s sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I?ve learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he?s near? I need to tread carefully, or I?m at risk of losing much more than just my freedom.Regret and revenge war inside of me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.Because I won?t be caught in a cage again. No, this time, It?ll be me setting the trap&#8230; I just hope my heart comes out </p>

<p>Summary : Os darksiders pediram mais mang?s na casa do terror. A DarkSide Books ouviu o chamado dos leitores e publicou o primeiro volume de A Menina do Outro Lado, de Nagabe. O tra?o ?mpar e delicado do mangak? tocou o cora??o de todos que mergulharam nesse conto de fadas dark ? e os leitores pediram mais. ? hora de comemorar! A DarkSide Books mais uma vez ouviu os pedidos dos seus amados leitores e vai lan?ar, em abril, a continua??o de A Menina do Outro Lado. No primeiro volume, somos apresentados a um pa?s dividido, onde perigos espreitam na floresta e nas redondezas, e conhecemos a hist?ria de Shiva, uma encantadora menininha que foi acolhida pela estranha criatura meio animal e meio humana que ela chama de Sensei. Ela n?o pode toc?-lo, sen?o ser? amaldi?oada. Quando um forasteiro invade a casa que eles habitam e toca no rosto de Shiva, tudo parece estar perdido. Com mais perguntas do que respostas, Shiva e Sensei partem em uma jornada em busca da verdade. Estaria a garotinha correndo </p>

<p>Summary : When Russ Callaghan and Aurora Roberts cross paths at a college party, a drinking game results in a passionate one-night stand. Never one to overstay her welcome (or expect much from a man), Aurora slips away before Russ even has the chance to ask her full name.  Imagine their surprise when they bump into each other on their first day as summer camp counsellors, hoping to escape their complicated home lives for the summer break.  As the summer unfolds, the tension between them intensifies. Russ doesn?t want to risk breaking the camp?s strict ?no staff fraternising? rule but, unfortunately for him, Aurora has never been very good at caring about rules.

<p>Summary : When Russ Callaghan and Aurora Roberts cross paths at a college party, a drinking game results in a passionate one-night stand. Never one to overstay her welcome (or expect much from a man), Aurora slips away before Russ even has the chance to ask her full name.  Imagine their surprise when they bump into each other on their first day as summer camp counsellors, hoping to escape their complicated home lives for the summer break.  As the summer unfolds, the tension between them intensifies. Russ doesn?t want to risk breaking the camp?s strict ?no staff fraternising? rule but, unfortunately for him, Aurora has never been very good at caring about rules. Will the two learn to peacefully co-exist? Or did their one night together start a fire they can?t put out?</p>

<p>Summary : A gifted young knight named Collum arrives at Camelot to compete for a spot on the Round Table, only to find he?s too late. The king died two weeks ago at the Battle of Camlann, leaving no heir, and only a handful of the knights of the Round Table survive.They aren?t the heroes of legend, like Lancelot or Gawain. They?re the oddballs of the Round Tables, from the edges of the stories, like Sir Palomides, the Saracen Knight and Sir Dagonet, Arthur?s fool, who was knighted as a joke. They?re joined by Nimue, who was Merlin?s apprentice until she turned on him and buried him under a hill. Together this ragtag fellowship will set out to rebuild Camelot in a world that has lost its balance.But Arthur?s death has revealed Britain?s fault lines. God has abandoned it, and the fairies and monsters and old gods are returning, led by Arthur?s half-sister Morgan le Fay. Kingdoms are turning on each other, warlords are laying siege to Camelot, and rival factions are forming around the disgraced </p>

<p>Summary : Melody faces her fears to follow her passion in this sequel to Out of My Mind.Melody is a year older, and a year braver. And now with her Medi-talker, she feels nothing?s out of her reach, not even summer camp. There have to be camps for differently-abled kids like her, and she?s going to sleuth one out. A place where she can trek through a forest, fly on a zip line, and even ride on a horse! A place where maybe she really can finally make a real friend, make her own decisions, and even do things on her own?the dream!  By the light of flickering campfires and the power of thunderstorms, through the terror of unexpected creatures in cabins and the first sparkle of a crush, Melody?s about to discover how brave and strong she really is.</p>

<p>Summary : What would it be like to sit down for an impassioned, entertaining conversation with Hillary Clinton? In Something Lost, Something Gained, Hillary offers her candid views on life and love, politics, liberty, democracy, the threats we face, and the future within our reach.She describes the strength she draws from her deepest friendships, her Methodist faith, and the nearly fifty years she?s been married to President Bill Clinton?all with the wisdom that comes from looking back on a full life with fresh eyes. She takes us along as she returns to the classroom as a college professor, enjoys the bonds inside the exclusive club of former First Ladies, moves past her dream of being president, and dives into new activism for women and democracy.From canoeing with an ex-Nazi trying to deprogram white supremacists to sweltering with salt farmers in the desert trying to adapt to the climate crisis in India, Hillary brings us to the front lines of our biggest challenges.

<p>Summary : Two books in one: Irwin Shaw&#8217;s bestselling Rich Man, Poor Man and Beggarman, Thief chronicle one family&#8217;s struggle with the forces of change after WWII.  In Rich Man, Poor Man, siblings Rudy, Tom, and Gretchen Jordache grow up in a small town on the Hudson River. They&#8217;re in their teens in the 1940s, too young to go to war but marked by it nevertheless. Their father is the local baker, and nothing suggests they will live storied lives. Yet, in this sprawling saga, each member of the family pushes against the grain of history and confronts the perils and pleasures of a world devastated by conflict and transformed by American commerce and culture.  In Beggarman, Thief, the Jordache family reunites after a terrible act of violence. Wesley never really knew his father, Tom, the black sheep of the Jordache family. Driven by his sorrow and a need for justice, Wesley uncovers surprising truths about his estranged family&#8217;s complicated past.An important voice in twentieth-century American </p>

<p>Summary : In a small town in Appalachia, people paint their doorways blue to keep spirits away.Black ferns grow where death will follow.And Weatherly Opal Wilder is a Death Talker.When called upon, she can talk the death out of the dying and save their lives; only once, never twice.

Right before she is killed in an accident, Adaire saw something unnerving, and that?s why Weatherly believes she was murdered?never thinking for a moment that it was an accident. But when Weatherly, for the first time, is unable to talk the death out of the mayor?s son, the whole town suspects she is out for revenge, that she?wouldn?t?save him.With the help of clues Adaire left behind and her family?s Granny Witch recipe box, Weatherly sets </p>

Countless women play by the biased male rules of dating and relationships, ones that keep them in a constant state of stress and worry.

Why are you preparing home cooked meals for a man that can&#8217;t provide you a home? Why are you having sex with a man that promises the world, but refuses to give you his heart? Why are you playing by outdated rules in hopes that one day your kindness will be rewarded? I have discovered a group of women who refuse to be exploited, are immune to manipulation, and who never settle in the name of love. These ladies know what they want and take what they want by beating men at their own game. Utilizing the secrets </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  A young girl forced to work in a Queens sweatshop calls child services on her mother in this powerful debut memoir about labor and self-worth that traces a Chinese immigrant&#8217;s journey to an American future. <br />
As a teen, Anna Qu is sent by her mother to work in her family&#8217;s garment factory in Queens. At home, she is treated as a maid and suffers punishment for doing her homework at night. Her mother wants to teach her a lesson: she is Chinese, not American, and such is their tough path in their new country. But instead of acquiescing, Qu alerts the Office of Children and Family Services, an act with consequences that impact the rest of her life.Nearly twenty years later, estranged from her mother and working at a Manhattan start-up, Qu requests her OCFS report. When it arrives, key details are wrong. Faced with this false narrative, and on the brink of losing her job as the once-shiny start-up collapses, Qu looks once more at her life&#8217;s truths, from abandonment to an abusive family </p>

<p>Summary : There&#8217;s more trouble afoot for the little girl whose Granny is a (shhh, whisper it) witch, whom we first met in Hubble Bubble Granny Trouble. Granny just loves to magic things along and a trip to the supermarket is anything but ordinary. However, Pandora quite likes things to be normal(ish) and when fishfingers start flying around she soon tells her Granny to behave. But when Pandora spots a couple of robbers up to no good, an extra-ordinary magical Granny is exactly what&#8217;s needed! &#8220;My granny&#8217;s rather&#8230; different, as you can plainly see. Her handbag pops and hisses and her pets are slippery! Her house is in a quiet street although it&#8217;s kind of batty! She&#8217;d have the neighbours round for tea, except they&#8217;re not that chatty&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : There&#8217;s more trouble afoot for the little girl whose Granny is a (shhh, whisper it) witch, whom we first met in Hubble Bubble Granny Trouble. Granny just loves to magic things along and a trip to the supermarket is anything but ordinary. However, Pandora quite likes things to be normal(ish) and when fishfingers start flying around she soon tells her Granny to behave. But when Pandora spots a couple of robbers up to no good, an extra-ordinary magical Granny is exactly what&#8217;s needed! &#8220;My granny&#8217;s rather&#8230; different, as you can plainly see. Her handbag pops and hisses and her pets are slippery! Her house is in a quiet street although it&#8217;s kind of batty! She&#8217;d have the neighbours round for tea, except they&#8217;re not that chatty&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : As a hospice nurse, Zara Mitchell has already seen more death than most people will experience in a lifetime. So when her older sister asks her to help care for their ailing grandmother, Zara agrees?despite strained family relationships.Though pale and tired, Nonna has lost none of her sharp mind. She?s fixated on finding something long forgotten, and she immediately puts Zara to work cleaning out the attic. Unexpectedly, amid the tedium of sifting through knickknacks and heirlooms, Zara also reconnects with a man she?s attracted to but whose complicated past makes romance seem impossible.But then Zara finds what Nonna was looking for: a wooden chest, an emerald broach, a leather-bound journal. As she immerses herself in stories of heroism and loss set against the backdrop of war-torn Italy in 1943, Zara finds answers to questions she didn?t know she had. And they change everything she thinks she knows about love, regret, and seizing the day.</p>

<p>Summary : For over fifty years, New York Times bestseller Mastering the Art of French Cooking has been the definitive book on the subject for American readers. Featuring 524 delicious recipes, in its pages home cooks will find something for everyone, from seasoned experts to beginners who love good food and long to reproduce the savory delights of French cuisine, from historic Gallic masterpieces to the seemingly artless perfection of a dish of spring-green peas. Here Julia Child, Simone Beck, and Louisette Bertholle break down the classic foods of France into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of dishes. Throughout, the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations&#8211;bound to increase anyone&#8217;s culinary repertoire. With over 100 instructive illustrations to guide readers every step of the way, Mastering the Art of French Cooking deserves a place of honor </p>

<p>Summary : This powerful memoir from a #1 New York Times bestselling author and Newbery Medalist features poetry, letters, recipes, and other personal artifacts that provide an intimate look into his life and the loved ones he shares it with. In an intimate and non-traditional (or &#8220;new-fashioned&#8221;) memoir, Kwame Alexander shares snapshots of a man learning how to love. He takes us through stories of his from being awkward newlyweds in the sticky Chicago summer of 1967, to the sometimes-confusing ways they showed their love to each other, and for him. He explores his own relationships?his difficulties as a newly wedded, 22-year-old father, and the precariousness of his early marriage working in a jazz club with his second wife. Alexander attempts to deal with the unravelling of his marriage and the grief of his mother&#8217;s recent passing while sharing the solace he found in learning how to perfect her famous fried chicken dish. With an open heart, Alexander weaves together memories of his past to </p>

Without blinking, she turned my simple world into a real nightmare-before-Christmas, especially when she decided to enter the town Christmas Kringle contest &#8211; which she was determine to win.Well guess what? Over my cold-hearted body.There was no way I was going to let her win, not after the history we&#8217;d shared.So despite my promise to myself of never participating in the sickening Christmas season, I entered the competition as well. That&#8217;s </p>

<p>Summary : The only life Tress has known on her island home in an emerald-green ocean has been a simple one, with the simple pleasures of collecting cups brought by sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend Charlie. But when his father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Amid the spore oceans where pirates abound, can Tress leave her simple life behind and make her own place sailing a sea where a single drop of water can mean instant death?</p>

<p>Summary : In 1938, just after publication of his all-time best-seller Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill revealed that he had broken the Devil&#8217;s Code, forcing him to confess his secrets. The resulting manuscript &#8211; Outwitting the Devil &#8211; proved so controversial, it was hidden for more than 70 years. Now, Sharon Lechter brings us this important book, annotating and editing it for a contemporary audience. Using his legendary ability to get to the root of human potential, Hill digs deep to identify the greatest obstacles we face in reaching our personal goals &#8211; including fear, procrastination, anger, and jealousy &#8211; as tools orchestrated by the Devil himself. These hidden methods of control can lead us to ruin, and Hill reveals the seven principles of good that will allow us to finally triumph over them and succeed.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1938, just after publication of his all-time best-seller Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill revealed that he had broken the Devil&#8217;s Code, forcing him to confess his secrets. The resulting manuscript &#8211; Outwitting the Devil &#8211; proved so controversial, it was hidden for more than 70 years. Now, Sharon Lechter brings us this important book, annotating and editing it for a contemporary audience. Using his legendary ability to get to the root of human potential, Hill digs deep to identify the greatest obstacles we face in reaching our personal goals &#8211; including fear, procrastination, anger, and jealousy &#8211; as tools orchestrated by the Devil himself. These hidden methods of control can lead us to ruin, and Hill reveals the seven principles of good that will allow us to finally triumph over them and succeed.</p>

Omens of disaster, swiftly following, transport Melanie from rural comfort to London, to the Magic Toyshop. To the red-haired, dancing Finn, the gentle Francie, dumb Aunt Margaret and Uncle Phillip. Francie plays curious night music, Finn kisses fifteen-year-old Melanie in the mysterious ruins of the pleasure gardens. Brooding over all is Uncle Philip: Uncle Philip, with blank eyes the colour of wet newspaper, making puppets the size of men, and clockwork roses. He loves his magic puppets, but hates the love of man for woman, boy for girl, brother for sister.</p>

Omens of disaster, swiftly following, transport Melanie from rural comfort to London, to the Magic Toyshop. To the red-haired, dancing Finn, the gentle Francie, dumb Aunt Margaret and Uncle Phillip. Francie plays curious night music, Finn kisses fifteen-year-old Melanie in the mysterious ruins of the pleasure gardens. Brooding over all is Uncle Philip: Uncle Philip, with blank eyes the colour of wet newspaper, making puppets the size of men, and clockwork roses. He loves his magic puppets, but hates the love of man for woman, boy for girl, brother for sister.</p>

<p>Summary : Continuing the story of The Hobbit, this three-volume boxed set of Tolkien&#8217;s epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, features striking black covers based on Tolkien&#8217;s own design, the definitive text, and three maps including a detailed map of Middle-earth.Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power &#8211; the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring &#8211; the ring that rules them all &#8211; which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, </p>

<p>Summary : An NBC Dateline producer&#8217;s cinematic account of two decades navigating a broken criminal justice system to help free six innocent men. In 2002, Dan Slepian, a veteran producer for NBC?s Dateline, received a tip from a Bronx homicide detective that would change his life. Two men were serving twenty-five years to life in prison for a murder in 1990, the cop said, and he knew for a fact that they did not commit that crime.Haunted by what he had heard, Slepian began an investigation that eventually led to freedom for those two men, and launched him on a two-decade personal and professional journey through a system fiercely resistant to rectifying?or even acknowledging?its mistakes and their consequences.The Sing Sing: One Journalist, Six Innocent Men, and a Twenty-Year Fight for Justice is an investigative journalist?s account of how he took on that system and of the years of prison visits, court hearings and powerful Dateline reporting it took to bring justice to those two men and four </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&#8217; ?Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7First published in 1903, James Allen&#8217;s literary essay became an inspirational classic. It shows how, in his own thought-world, each man holds the key to every condition, good or bad, that enters into his life, and that, by working patiently and intelligently upon his thoughts, he may remake his life, and transform his circumstances.You can have everything you&#8217;ve ever wanted-a fulfilling life, a job you&#8217;re passionate about, true love, unlimited wealth, and a healthy body. Seriously, you can have it all. You just need to do one thing.Think.Surprised? Don&#8217;t be. Thousands of people, people exactly like you, have transformed their life for the better. They&#8217;ve discovered the power of thought, and used it to make their dreams a reality. And now, it&#8217;s your turn.Everything in your life is an external manifestation of your thoughts; what you hold within, gets reflected outside. Do you know what this means?It means you </p>

A leader or organization you respect turns out to be different than they portray themselves to be. A spouse cheats on you. A family member betrays you.

Lysa TerKeurst says it&#8217;s not simply about finding better people to walk with.

Until one day, while getting her hair done in a Beverly Hills salon, she met a man and instantly knew he was the one she&#8217;d been looking for. Beautiful, athletic, artistic, and from a well-to-do family, Jeffrey Harrison appeared to be Debra&#8217;s ideal sperm donor. A verbal agreement, a couple of thousand in cash, and a few squirts of a turkey baster later, and Chrysta was conceived. Over the years, Jeffrey would make regular appearances at the family home, which grew to include Chrysta&#8217;s baby sister.

<p>Summary : My son and I are in danger. The life and death kind. The kind that forces me to make choices no mother should have to. I?ll do anything to keep my son safe and not sacrifice my responsibility to my patients. I?m desperate. Desperate enough to beg broody Special Agent Micah Emmett for help. But he has a job, and it doesn?t include protecting me. Why should he? He doesn?t know me. Or so I thought. Because you can learn a lot about another person when they?re being tapped. And Micah has been watching me for a long time. Now the special agent is glued to my side. And I&#8217;ve been tapped in more ways than one.</p>

All to pose that proverbial question: Can a gurl live?Rage is one part memoir, one part cultural critique, one part live grenade.
