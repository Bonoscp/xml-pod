<p>Summary : Percy Jackson, modern-day son of Poseidon, is just trying to get through high school. After saving the world multiple times by battling monsters, Titans, and giants, Percy is now settling in at Alternative High School in New York, where he hopes to finally have a normal senior year. Unfortunately, the gods aren?t quite done with him yet. Poseidon breaks the bad news that if Percy expects to get into New Rome University, he will have to fulfill three quests in order to earn the necessary three letters of recommendation from Mount Olympus. The first task is to help Ganymede, Zeus?s cupbearer, retrieve his golden goblet before it falls into the wrong hands. You see, one sip from it can turn a mortal into a god, and Zeus would not be pleased with that result. Can Percy and his friends Grover and Annabeth find the precious cup in time? And if they do, will they be able to resist its special power?Readers new to Percy Jackson universe and fans who have been awaiting this reunion for more </p>

<p>Summary : Effy Sayre has always believed in fairy tales. Haunted by visions of the Fairy King since childhood, she?s had no choice. Her tattered copy of Angharad?Emrys Myrddin?s epic about a mortal girl who falls in love with the Fairy King, then destroys him?is the only thing keeping her afloat. So when Myrddin?s family announces a contest to redesign the late author?s estate, Effy feels certain it?s her destiny. But musty, decrepit Hiraeth Manor is an impossible task, and its residents are far from welcoming. Including Preston H?loury, a stodgy young literature scholar determined to expose Myrddin as a fraud. As the two rivals piece together clues about Myrddin?s legacy, dark forces, both mortal and magical, conspire against them?and the truth may bring them both to ruin.</p>

<p>Summary : A riveting family drama evocative of Angela?s Ashes and The Glass Castle, about a woman who discovers the shocking secret at the center of her mother?s life.Justine had always been told that her mother came from royal blood. The proof could be found in her mother?s elegance, in the uppercrust London accent she had never shed?and in a cryptic letter hinting at her claim to a country estate. But beneath the polished veneer lay a fearsome, unpredictable temper that drove Justine from home the moment she was old enough to escape. Years later, when her mother sent her an envelope filled with secrets from a past that had never been spoken about, Justine buried it in the back of an old filing cabinet.After her mother?s death, overcome with grief, Justine found herself drawn back to that envelope.

Her mother did not </p>

<p>Summary : In her first solo memoir, New York Times bestselling author Joanna Gaines invites us on an authentic and deeply vulnerable journey into her story&#8211;and helps shine a light on the beauty of our own&#8211;guiding us to release the weights that hold us back so we may live and share our story in truth.We&#8217;ve all dropped anchor in places that suited us for a time: a city, a perspective, a lie we mistook as truth. This book is an invitation to a kind of life where you know how to hold what you believe&#8211;about yourself and the quiet worlds behind the people you pass&#8211;with gracious and open hands. To see your story as greater than any past or future thing, but for all the beauty and joy and hope it holds today. It&#8217;s an invitation to take stock of the chapters you&#8217;ve lived&#8211;the good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly&#8211;glean what&#8217;s gold, and carry only that forward. Let it slow your feet and steady your life-in-motion so you can see where you stand today from a new point of view. No longer </p>

Zola, romanc?n?n olaylar? bir izleyici gibi kaydetmekle yetinmemesi, ki?ileri ve tutkular?n? bir dizi deneyden ge?irirken, duygusal ve toplumsal olgular? bir kimyac? gibi i?lemesi gerekti?ini savundu. Kuzey Fransada uzla?maya yana?mayan maden i??ilerinin grevini konu alan Germinal sadece Zolan?n de?il, Frans?z edebiyat?n?n da en de?erli eserleri aras?nda say?lmaktad?r.</p>

<p>Summary : For the first time ever, a special enhanced edition of the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings, illustrated throughout with over 50 sketches, drawings, paintings and maps by J. R. R. Tolkien himself and with the complete text printed in two colours.Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey ?there and back again?. They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon?Written for J.R.R. Tolkien?s own children, The Hobbit was published on 21 September 1937.

<p>Summary : Anthony C. Yu?s translation of The Journey to the West,initially published in 1983, introduced English-speaking audiences to the classic Chinese novel in its entirety for the first time. Written in the sixteenth century, The Journey to the West tells the story of the fourteen-year pilgrimage of the monk Xuanzang, one of China?s most famous religious heroes, and his three supernatural disciples, in search of Buddhist scriptures. Throughout his journey, Xuanzang fights demons who wish to eat him, communes with spirits, and traverses a land riddled with a multitude of obstacles, both real and fantastical. An adventure rich with danger and excitement, this seminal work of the Chinese literary canonis by turns allegory, satire, and fantasy.With over a hundred chapters written in both prose and poetry, The Journey to the West has always been a complicated and difficult text to render in English while preserving the lyricism of its language and the content of its plot. But Yu has </p>

An adventure rich with danger and excitement, this seminal work of the Chinese literary canonis by turns allegory, satire, and fantasy.With over a hundred chapters written in both prose and poetry, The Journey to the West has always been a complicated and difficult text to render in English while preserving the lyricism of its language and the content of its plot.

<p>Summary : By way of H. G. Wells and Rebecca West?s affair through 1930s nuclear physics to Flanagan&#8217;s father working as a slave labourer near Hiroshima when the atom bomb is dropped, this genre-defying daisy chain of events reaches fission when Flanagan as a young man finds himself trapped in a rapid on a wild river not knowing if he is to live or to die.At once a love song to his island home and to his parents, this hypnotic melding of dream, history, literature, place and memory is about how reality is never made by realists and how our lives so often arise out of the stories of others and the stories we invent about ourselves.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;When discussing greatness, we have too often distilled it down to how many rings someone has won, neglecting to celebrate the incredible influence that players have had on the evolution of basketball. Kirk&#8217;s book beautifully explains this other side of greatness?how one player&#8217;s skill and style of play can change the game forever.&#8221;?JJ RedickThe bestselling?author of?Sprawlball, Kirk Goldsberry returns with a visual feast of a book?equal parts?Book of Basketball?and Shea Serrano?that uses sharp writing, his signature graphics, and cutting-edge statistical analyses to unpack how a handful of NBA superstars ?MJ to Lebron to Jokic?have reshaped pro basketball and charted the course to the future of the NBA.Every few years a talent comes along that disrupts everything we think we know about how the NBA should work. Whether it?s scoring, playmaking, or shooting, these are players and tactics that fundamentally challenge how the game is played and what greatness looks like on a basketball </p>

<p>Summary : Il protagonista della nostra storia di lavoro fa il postino, mette in comunicazione tutti gli altri ma accanto a s? non ha nessuno. La sua unica compagnia ? un gatto, Cavolo, con cui divide un piccolo appartamento. I giorni passano pigri e tutti uguali, fin quando quello che sembrava un fastidioso mal di testa si trasforma nell?annuncio di una malattia incurabile. Come passare la settimana che gli resta da vivere? Riesce a stento a compilare la lista delle dieci cose da provare prima di morire&#8230; Non resta nulla da fare, se non disperarsi: ma ecco che ci mette lo zampino il Diavolo in persona. E come ogni diavolo che si rispetti, anche quello della nostra storia propone un patto. Un giorno di pi? di vita in cambio di qualcosa? Con la delicatezza di Sep?lveda e il gusto per il fantastico di Murakami, Kawamura Genki ha scritto una fiaba moderna per ricordarci quali sono le cose davvero importanti.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  An inspiring and intimate self-portrait of a champion of equality that encompasses her brilliant tennis career, unwavering activism, and an ongoing commitment to fairness and social justice. <br />
Billie Jean King was only seven years old when she told her mother, I&#8217;m going to do something great with my life someday. But the world she wanted did not exist yet, so she set out to create it. In this spirited account, King details her life&#8217;s journey to find her true self. She recounts her groundbreaking tennis successes that came at a breathtaking pace&#8211;six years as the top-ranked woman in the world, twenty Wimbledon championships, thirty-nine grand-slam titles, and her watershed defeat of Bobby Riggs in the famous Battle of the Sexes. King poignantly recalls the cultural backdrop of her career and the profound impact on her worldview from the women&#8217;s movement, the assassinations and anti-war protests of the 1960s, the civil rights movement, and, eventually, the LGBTQ+ rights movement.King </p>

<p>Summary : A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA Today Show #ReadwithJenna Book Club Pick</p>
<p>A propulsive and uncommonly wise novel about one unexpected wedding guest and the surprising people who help her start anew. It?s a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone.

Phoebe is here because she?s dreamed of coming for years?she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she?s here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe&#8217;s plan?which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can?t stop confiding in each </p>

Masking is a common coping mechanism in which Autistic people hide their identifiably Autistic traits in order to fit in with societal norms, adopting a superficial personality at the expense of their mental health.

<p>Summary : She doesn&#8217;t want to hurt him ? she just wants to punish him?Being the only female owner of the Salacious Players&#8217; Club, Maggie Anderson thought her life was hard enough. But as the club continued to grow, she felt more and more on the outskirts as the only one who didn&#8217;t have a kink. Or so she thought? When she takes a kink quiz on the club&#8217;s new app and learns that she&#8217;s a Domme, she realizes that she might not be quite so vanilla after all. In fact, she&#8217;s a lot more like her colleague, Emerson Grant, than she thought. There&#8217;s just one problem ? she doesn&#8217;t know how to be a Domme. Or she didn&#8217;t, until the app matched her with someone willing to learn. But he&#8217;s too young. Too stubborn. Too good looking. And, to top it off, Emerson&#8217;s son.Beau Grant is a brat. And Maggie would hate that about him it if she didn&#8217;t love punishing him so much. Yet she&#8217;s beginning to see that underneath his attitude, Beau is misunderstood, self-less, and in need of direction. But if it&#8217;s mercy he&#8217;s after, </p>

<p>Summary : 24 ?berraschende literarische T?rchen24 kleine literarische Episoden, die mal heiter, mal besinnlich durch die Vorweihnachtszeit f?hren. Da gibt es schnatternde Wildg?nse und einen geklauten Tannenbaum bei Hans Fallada, ein Weihnachtsfest mit den Buddenbrooks und Winterpost von Rainer Maria Rilke und Liselotte von der Pfalz. Neben Gedichten, Briefen und Ausz?gen aus bekannten weihnachtlichen Erz?hlungen wird es auch die eine oder andere ?berraschung geben, indem manch ein altbekannter Klassiker seine weihnachtliche Seite offenbart.</p>

<p>Summary : He&#8217;s not just rich?he&#8217;s filthy rich. When Daisy Bennett started working at Salacious Players&#8217; Club, she never expected to end up on the auction block ready to grant a date to the highest bidder. She only took the waitressing job to learn more about a mysterious man from her mother&#8217;s past?Ronan Kade. So when Ronan, the richest man at the club, wins the date, Daisy can&#8217;t say no. But he&#8217;s too old. Too rich. Too cocky. And, oh yeah?he once dated Daisy&#8217;s mother. Ronan knows there&#8217;s something about Daisy he can&#8217;t get enough of, but he has no idea who she is or why they seem to have an undeniable connection. All he can say for sure is that he loves the way she calls him Daddy. One date inevitably leads to more, and Ronan is ready to put his heart on the line, but both he and Daisy will have to be honest about the secrets they&#8217;ve been keeping if they want their chance at something real?</p>

<p>Summary : He&#8217;s not just rich?he&#8217;s filthy rich. When Daisy Bennett started working at Salacious Players&#8217; Club, she never expected to end up on the auction block ready to grant a date to the highest bidder. She only took the waitressing job to learn more about a mysterious man from her mother&#8217;s past?Ronan Kade. So when Ronan, the richest man at the club, wins the date, Daisy can&#8217;t say no. But he&#8217;s too old. Too rich. Too cocky. And, oh yeah?he once dated Daisy&#8217;s mother. Ronan knows there&#8217;s something about Daisy he can&#8217;t get enough of, but he has no idea who she is or why they seem to have an undeniable connection. All he can say for sure is that he loves the way she calls him Daddy. One date inevitably leads to more, and Ronan is ready to put his heart on the line, but both he and Daisy will have to be honest about the secrets they&#8217;ve been keeping if they want their chance at something real?</p>

<p>Summary : WARNING &#8211; this book includes: heavy crimes, car journeys, dreadfulness, large fruits, romance, planning applications, and a lot of pie.Gary Thorn is struggling with a big decision. Should he stay in London, wallowing in the safety of his legal job in Peckham and eating pies with his next door neighbour, Grace and her dog Lassoo, or should he move to Brighton, where his girlfriend Emily is about to open The Hotel Avocado? Either way, he?d be letting someone down. But sinister forces are gathering in a cloud of launderette scented-vape smoke, and the arrival of the mysterious Mr Sequence puts Gary in an even worse predicament: soon he might be dead. All Gary wants is a happy life. But he also wants to be alive to enjoy it?</p>

<p>Summary : A TIMES BOOK OF THE YEAR 2021In Rationality, Pinker rejects the cynical clich? that humans are simply an irrational species &#8211; cavemen out of time fatally cursed with biases, fallacies and illusions. After all, we discovered the laws of nature, lengthened and enriched our lives and set the benchmarks for rationality itself. Instead, he explains, we think in ways that suit the low-tech contexts in which we spend most of our lives, but fail to take advantage of the powerful tools of reasoning we have built up over millennia: logic, critical thinking, probability, causal inference, and decision-making under uncertainty. These tools are not a standard part of our educational curricula, and have never been presented clearly and entertainingly in a single book &#8211; until now.Rationality matters. It leads to better choices in our lives and in the public sphere, and is the ultimate driver of social justice and moral progress. Brimming with insight and humour, Rationality will enlighten, inspire </p>

<p>Summary : A TIMES BOOK OF THE YEAR 2021In Rationality, Pinker rejects the cynical clich? that humans are simply an irrational species &#8211; cavemen out of time fatally cursed with biases, fallacies and illusions. After all, we discovered the laws of nature, lengthened and enriched our lives and set the benchmarks for rationality itself. Instead, he explains, we think in ways that suit the low-tech contexts in which we spend most of our lives, but fail to take advantage of the powerful tools of reasoning we have built up over millennia: logic, critical thinking, probability, causal inference, and decision-making under uncertainty. These tools are not a standard part of our educational curricula, and have never been presented clearly and entertainingly in a single book &#8211; until now.Rationality matters. It leads to better choices in our lives and in the public sphere, and is the ultimate driver of social justice and moral progress. Brimming with insight and humour, Rationality will enlighten, inspire </p>

<p>Summary : The ultimate eye-opening journey through time and space, A Short History of Nearly Everything is the biggest-selling popular science book of the 21st century and has sold over 2 million copies.Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller, but even when he stays safely at home he can&#8217;t contain his curiosity about the world around him. A Short History of Nearly Everything is his quest to understand everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization &#8211; how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill Bryson&#8217;s challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn&#8217;t some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science.The ultimate eye-opening journey through time and space, A Short History of Nearly Everything is the biggest-selling popular science book of the 21st century, and reveals the world </p>

<p>Summary : A turbulent romance meets harrowing medical mystery, Eleanor Henderson&#8217;s Everything I Have Is Yours is the true story of a twenty-year marriage defined by the author?s husband?s physical and mental illness and a testament to the enduring power of love. Eleanor met Aaron when she was just a teenager and he was working at a local record store?older, cool, experienced, and with an electric personality. Escaping the clich?s of fleeting young love, their summer romance bloomed into a relationship that survived college and culminated in a marriage and two children. From the outside looking in, their life had all the trappings of what most would consider a success story. But, like any marriage, things weren?t always as they seemed. When Aaron one day began complaining about burning rashes, Eleanor tried desperately to help.

<p>Summary : A daughter returns home to the Navajo reservation to confront her family&#8217;s troubled history and retrace her mother&#8217;s life?using both narrative and archive in this unforgettable and heart-wrenching memoir.After Danielle Geller&#8217;s mother dies of a withdrawal from alcohol during a period of homelessness, she is forced to return to Florida. Using her training as a librarian and archivist, Geller collects her mother&#8217;s documents, diaries, and photographs into a single suitcase and begins on a journey of confronting her family&#8217;s history and the decisions she&#8217;s been forced to make, a journey that will end at her mother&#8217;s home: the Navajo reservation. Geller masterfully intertwines wrenching prose with archival documents to create a deeply moving narrative of loss and inheritance that pays homage to our pasts, traditions, heritage, the family we are given, and the family we choose.</p>

<p>Summary : Rare-book dealer Ashlyn Greer?s affinity for books extends beyond the intoxicating scent of old paper, ink, and leather. She can feel the echoes of the books? previous owners?an emotional fingerprint only she can read. When Ashlyn discovers a pair of beautifully bound volumes that appear to have never been published, her gift quickly becomes an obsession. Not only is each inscribed with a startling incrimination, but the authors, Hemi and Belle, tell conflicting sides of a tragic romance.With no trace of how these mysterious books came into the world, Ashlyn is caught up in a decades-old literary mystery, beckoned by two hearts in ruins, whoever they were, wherever they are. Determined to learn the truth behind the doomed lovers? tale, she reads on, following a trail of broken promises and seemingly unforgivable betrayals. The more Ashlyn learns about Hemi and Belle, the nearer she comes to bringing closure to their love story?and to the unfinished chapters of her own life.</p>

<p>Summary : Der gro?e Bestseller endlich als Taschenbuch! ?Ein kluges Buch, das die Sicht auf die eigenen Grenzen ver?ndern kann.? FreundinKlug, emotional und bitters??: Die Mitternachtsbibliothek ist eine wunderbare Hymne auf das LebenStell dir vor, auf dem Weg ins Jenseits g?be es eine riesige Bibliothek, gef?llt mit all den Leben, die du h?ttest f?hren k?nnen. Alles, was du jemals bereut hast, k?nntest du ungeschehen machen. Genau dort findet sich Nora Seed wieder, nachdem sie aus lauter Verzweiflung beschlossen hat, sich das Leben zu nehmen. An diesem Ort zwischen Raum und Zeit, an dem die Uhrzeiger immer auf Mitternacht stehen, hat sie pl?tzlich die M?glichkeit, all das zu ?ndern, was sie aus der Bahn geworfen hat.

As someone who&#8217;s always been teased for being a country bumpkin, he doesn&#8217;t exactly have much in common with an extoverted?city boy. But when Takara makes a move on him one day, Kyouhei can&#8217;t get it out of his mind. Even though he can barely stand Takara, he can&#8217;t help finding himself strangely drawn to him. But Kyouhei&#8217;s not looking for a one night stand;?he&#8217;s looking for serious love!</p>

<p>Summary : Ever sworn off alcohol for a month and found yourself drinking by the 7th? Think there&#8217;s &#8216;no point&#8217; in just one drink? Welcome! There are millions of us. 64% of Brits want to drink less.Catherine Gray was stuck in a hellish whirligig of Drink, Make horrible decisions, Hangover, Repeat. She had her fair share of &#8216;drunk tank&#8217; jail cells and topless-in-a-hot-tub misadventures.

<p>Summary : The astounding, never-before-told story of how an audacious Ghanaian con artist pulled off one of the 20th century?s longest-running and most spectacular frauds.When Ghana won its independence from Britain in 1957, it instantly became a target for home-grown opportunists and rapacious Western interests determined to snatch any assets that colonialism hadn?t already stripped. A CIA-funded military junta ousted the new nation?s inspiring president, Kwame Nkrumah, then falsely accused him of hiding the country?s gold overseas.Into this big lie stepped one of history?s most charismatic scammers, a con man to rival the trickster god Anansi. Born into poverty in Ghana and trained in the United States, John Ackah Blay-Miezah declared himself custodian of an alleged Nkrumah trust fund worth billions.

Over the 1970s and ?80s, he and his accomplices?including </p>

<p>Summary : Eight ordinary people. One extraordinary choice.It seems like any other day. You wake up, pour a cup of coffee, and head out.But today, when you open your front door, waiting for you is a small wooden box. This box holds your fate inside: the answer to the exact number of years you will live.From suburban doorsteps to desert tents, every person on every continent receives the same box. In an instant, the world is thrust into a collective frenzy. Where did these boxes come from? What do they mean? Is there truth to what they promise?As society comes together and pulls apart, everyone faces the same shocking choice: Do they wish to know how long they?ll live? And, if so, what will they do with that knowledge?The Measure charts the dawn of this new world through an unforgettable cast of characters whose decisions and fates interweave with one another: best friends whose dreams are forever entwined, pen pals finding refuge in the unknown, a couple who thought they didn?t have to rush, a </p>

<p>Summary : This is the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child&#8217;s confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens. This is a story for anyone, at any age, who&#8217;s ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It&#8217;s a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow, and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn&#8217;t going anywhere. In fact, it&#8217;s just getting started.</p>

<p>Summary : Trevor Cox has been described by the Observer as ?a David Attenborough of the acoustic realm?. In Speech Odyssey he takes us on a journey through the wonders of human speech, starting with the evolution of language and our biological capability to speak (and listen), and bringing us up to date with the latest computer technology that seeks to record, transform and mimic the human voice.Language is what makes us human, and how we speak is integral to our personal identity.
