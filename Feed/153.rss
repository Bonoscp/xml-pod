<p>Summary : Sloane Reid has never believed in ghosts, even though she made a career out of playing a ghost slayer on film.  When the studio tells her at twenty-nine she?s too old to be a scream queen, Sloane retreats to her aunt?s remote Florida cabin to figure out what comes next.  Her trip is anything but relaxing when she encounters Chelsea, a young girl who died near the cabin thirteen years ago.  Chelsea is desperate for Sloane?s help to reveal the truth that haunts her, but Sloane can?t solve the mystery alone. She needs to ask for help from local deputy Tristan Rogers, which means she?ll have to convince him she?s not crazy. Or a criminal.  As Sloane and Tristan unlock the secrets of the past, the stakes grow higher for them both, and soon Sloane finds it may be her own life that needs saving. </p>

<p>Summary : Librarian note: An older cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.The Republic of Gilead offers Offred only one option: to breed. If she deviates, she will, like all dissenters, be hanged at the wall or sent out to die slowly of radiation sickness. But even a repressive state cannot obliterate desire ? neither Offred?s nor that of the two men on whom her future hangs.Brilliantly conceived and executed, this powerful evocation of twenty-first century America gives full rein to Margaret Atwood?s devastating irony, wit and astute perception.</p>

<p>Summary : Librarian note: An older cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.The Republic of Gilead offers Offred only one option: to breed. If she deviates, she will, like all dissenters, be hanged at the wall or sent out to die slowly of radiation sickness. But even a repressive state cannot obliterate desire ? neither Offred?s nor that of the two men on whom her future hangs.Brilliantly conceived and executed, this powerful evocation of twenty-first century America gives full rein to Margaret Atwood?s devastating irony, wit and astute perception.</p>

Tony Tetro, one of the most renowned art forgers in history, will make you question every masterpiece you&#8217;ve ever seen in a museum, gallery, or private collection.

<p>Summary : The world&#8217;s most renowned art forger reveals the secrets behind his decades of painting like the masters&#8211;exposing an art world that is far more corrupt than we ever knew while providing an art history lesson wrapped in sex, drugs, and Caravaggio.

<p>Summary : Often called the greatest novel ever written, War and Peace is at once an epic of the Napoleonic Wars, a philosophical study, and a celebration of the Russian spirit. Tolstoy?s genius is seen clearly in the multitude of characters in this massive chronicle?all of them fully realized and equally memorable. Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual?s place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed War and Peace in the same category as the Iliad: ?To read him . . . is to find one?s way home . . . to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.?</p>

But damning my soul was just the beginning?it?s my heart the demon wants next.ZaneI?ve been hunting souls for centuries, but she?s the ultimate prize?vicious and feral with a broken soul as dark as my own.

<p>Summary : De wereldwijde bestseller van Thomas Erikson op basis van vier persoonlijkheidstypes: hoe hen te begrijpen die niet begrepen willen worden?Welke gedragsstijl is de jouwe? Drijf je collega je tot waanzin met zijn overdreven liefde voor details? Botst het gematigde karakter van je geliefde met je eigen enthousiasme? Sommige mensen beweren dat zij omringd worden door idioten. Zij begrijpen hun collega?s of familie niet, hoe ze ook hun best doen. Als je echter meer inzicht hebt in het gedrag van de ander, en dat van jezelf, kun je beter met de ander communiceren. Een veelgebruikte methode daarvoor is het aanduiden van gedragsstijlen met kleuren. Ben je bijvoorbeeld rood, dan wil je snel tot de kern van de zaak komen. Heb je voornamelijk gele kanten, dan ben je snel enthousiast, groen staat voor stabiliteit en blauwe eigenschappen hebben te maken met informatie en details. Thomas Erikson leert je om op praktische en eenvoudige wijze dit kleurenschema toe te passen. Omringd door idioten </p>

Det ?r ot?nkbart att nazisterna ska kunna invadera Frankrike.Men invasionen kommer, och i hennes hus flyttar det in en tysk kapten. Vianne har inget val ? om hon vill beh?lla sitt hem m?ste hon och dottern dela det med fienden.Allt eftersom kriget forts?tter blir bristen p? mat och pengar akut, och den hotfulla situationen tvingar Vianne till allt st?rre uppoffringar f?r att skydda sig sj?lv och sin familj.Samtidigt befinner sig Viannes syster Isabelle i Paris. Hon ?r en rebellisk arton?ring som v?grar acceptera det franska nederlaget. N?r hon f?r?lskar sig i en partisan dras hon med i motst?ndsr?relsen. F?r henne finns inga kompromisser och ingen v?g tillbaka.Kristin Hanna beskriver i N?ktergalen kvinnornas krig, den tillvaro p? hemmaplan som s?llan skildrats. Hennes ber?ttelse om de tv? systrarna i det ockuperade Frankrike blir en ber?ttelse om styrka och k?rlek i en om?jlig tid.</p>

<p>Summary : Simone de Beauvoir, novelist, dramatist, and philosopher, was the most distinguished woman writer in modern France. A leading exponent of French existentialism, her work complements, though it is independent of, that of Jean-Paul Sartre. In &#8220;The Ethics of Ambiguity,&#8221; Madame de Beauvoir penetrates at once to the central ethical problems of modern man: what shall he do, how shall he go about making values, in the face of this awareness of the absurdity of his existence? She forces the reader to face the absurdity of the human condition and then, having done so, proceeds to develop a dialectic of ambiguity which will enable him not to master the chaos, but to create with it.</p>

<p>Summary : A lo largo de la historia, algunos libros han cambiado el mundo. Han transformado la manera en que nos vemos a nosotros mismos y a los dem?s. Han inspirado el debate, la discordia, la guerra y la revoluci?n. Han iluminado, indignado, provocado y consolado. Han enriquecido vidas, y tambi?n las han destruido. Taurus publica las obras de los grandes pensadores, pioneros, radicales y visionarios cuyas ideas sacudieron la civilizaci?n y nos impulsaron a ser quienes somos.Las Meditaciones del gran emperador-fil?sofo romano Marco Aurelio son sencillas aunque profundas obras de filosof?a estoica que, a d?a de hoy, contin?an ofreciendo a muchos orientaci?n y consuelo con elocuencia, sabidur?a y humildad.</p>

<p>Summary : Less than three weeks before the 1960 presidential election, thirty-one-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr. was arrested at a sit-in at Rich&#8217;s Department Store in Atlanta. That day would lead to the first night King had ever spent in jail&#8211;and the time that King&#8217;s family most feared for his life. While King&#8217;s imprisonment was decried as a moral scandal in some quarters and celebrated in others, for the two presidential candidates&#8211;John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon&#8211;it was the ultimate October surprise: an emerging and controversial civil rights leader was languishing behind bars, and the two campaigns raced to decide whether, and how, to respond. Based on fresh interviews, newspaper accounts, and extensive archival research, Nine Days is the first full recounting of an event that changed the course of one of the closest elections in American history. Much more than a political thriller, it is also the story of the first time King refused bail and came to terms with the dangerous course </p>

<p>Summary : The Southern Reach Trilogy begins with Annihilation, the Nebula Award-winning novel that ?reads as if Verne or Wellsian adventurers exploring a mysterious island had warped through into a Kafkaesque nightmare world? (Kim Stanley Robinson).Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for years. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. Expeditions into Area X have ended in disaster or death.In Annihilation, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer?s Southern Reach Trilogy, we join the latest expedition. The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and the narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers?they discover lifeforms that surpass understanding. But it?s the secrets they carried across the border with them </p>

<p>Summary : G. K. Chesterton?s highly influential treatise on one of the most controversial topics of the early twentieth century When G. K. Chesterton first published Eugenics and Other Evils in 1922, he seemed to be the lone voice of reason against the fashionable concept of selectively breeding a population for ?desirable? traits. Though later generations came to associate eugenics with the horrors of the Third Reich, worldwide support for the philosophy was at an all-time high when Chesterton penned this brave and prophetic work. His unique combination of somber analysis and coruscating wit produces an argument too persuasive to ignore.?Eugenics and Other Evils showcases Chesterton at the height of his rhetorical powers. His discussion of capitalism, socialism, and the concerns that guide our moral decisions is as pertinent today as the day it was penned. ?

<p>Summary : &#8220;I must stop writing letters and get to writing a novel.&#8221;Shirley Jackson is one of the most important American authors of the last hundred years and among our greatest chroniclers of the female experience. This extraordinary compilation of personal correspondence has all the hallmarks of Jackson&#8217;s beloved fiction: flashes of the uncanny in the domestic, sparks of horror in the quotidian, and the veins of humor that turn through good times and bad.&#8221;I am having a fine time doing a novel with my left hand and a long story?with as many levels as Grand Central Station?with my right hand, stirring chocolate pudding with a spoon held in my teeth, and tuning the television with both feet.&#8221;Written over the course of nearly three decades, from Jackson&#8217;s college years to six days before her early death at the age of 48, these letters become the autobiography Shirley Jackson never wrote. As well as being a best-selling author, Jackson spent much of her adult life as a mother of four in Vermont, </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;When Se?n Hewitt meets Elias, the two fall headlong into a love story. But as Elias struggles with severe mental illness, they soon come face-to-face with crisis. All Down Darkness Wide is a perceptive and unflinching meditation on the burden of living in a world that too often sets happiness and queer life at odds, and a tender and honest portrayal of what it&#8217;s like to be caught in the undertow of a loved one&#8217;s deep depression. As lives are made and unmade, this memoir asks what love can endure and what it cannot. Delving into his own history, enlisting the ghosts of queer figures before him, Hewitt plumbs the darkness in search of answers. From a nineteenth-century cemetery in Liverpool to a sacred grotto in the Pyrenees, it is a journey of lonely discovery followed by the light of community. Haunted by the rites of Catholicism and spectres of shame, it is nevertheless marked by an insistent search for beauty. Hewitt captures transcendent moments in nature with exquisite lyricism, </p>

<p>Summary : When seventeen-year-old Bailey starts a new job at a hotel waterpark, she is less than thrilled to see an old acquaintance is one of her coworkers. Bailey met Charlie a year ago on the long flight to Omaha, where she moved after her parents? divorce. Charlie?s cynicism didn?t mix well with Bailey?s carefully well-behaved temperament, and his endless commentary was the irritating cherry on top of an already emotionally fraught trip. Now, Bailey and Charlie are still polar opposites, but instead of everything about him rubbing Bailey the wrong way, she starts to look forward to hanging out and gossiping about the waterpark guests and their coworkers?particularly two who keep flirting with each other. Bailey and Charlie make a bet on whether or not the cozy pair will actually get together. Charlie insists that members of the opposite sex can?t just be friends, and Bailey is determined to prove him wrong.  Bailey and Charlie keep close track of the romantic progress of others while </p>

Bilim-kurgu ve spek?latif edebiyat?n ?nc? adlar?ndan olan Jules Verne, bu yap?t?nda ger?ek bir ortamdan, ?ss?z Estados Adas??ndaki deniz fenerinden esinlenmi?ti. Yazar?n yap?ttaki titiz co?rafi betimlemeleri, ayr?nt?larla ?rd??? denizcilik bilgileri, insanl???n ufkunda ya?anan bir ser?venin hem dekorunu hem ara?lar?n? olu?turuyordu. 1859 k???nda ?al??maya ba?layan fenerin ilk bek?ileri Vasquez, Felipe ve Moriz, G?ney Atlantik?in g?neydo?u ucunda, iki okyanusu birbirine ba?layan ticaret gemilerine k?lavuzluk ederken, ?ok ge?meden adada yaln?z olmad?klar?n? sezeceklerdi. En ?etin do?a ko?ullar?na dayan?kl? in?a edilmi? olan bu fener, uygarl???n s?n?r?nda ya?amaktan beslenen sinsi d??manlara da ayn? ?ekilde dayanabilecek miydi? Jules Verne ak?l ile g?c?n, nitelik ile niceli?in, hesap ile h?rs?n k?yas?ya ?eki?ti?i ?nc? bir ser?ven ?yk?s? sunuyor okura.</p>

<p>Summary : In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities?and also the faults and biases?of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation?each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot </p>

<p>Summary : Forty years after the Oblivion crisis, the empire of Tamriel is threatened by a mysterious floating city, Umbriel, whose shadow spawns a terrifying undead army. Reeling from a devastating discovery, Prince Attrebus continues on his seemingly doomed quest to obtain a magic sword that holds the key to destroying the deadly invaders. Meanwhile, in the Imperial City, the spy Colin finds evidence of betrayal at the heart of the empire&#8211;if his own heart doesn&#8217;t betray him first. And Anna?g, trapped in Umbriel itself, has become a slave to its dark lord and his insatiable hunger for souls. How can these three unlikely heroes save Tamriel when they cannot even save themselves?</p>

<p>Summary : Tales of the unknown in which a fix-it man crosses into another dimension?and more Hiram Taine is a handyman who can fix anything. When he isn?t fiddling with his tools, he is roaming through the woods with his dog, Towser, as he has done for as long as he can remember. He likes things that he can understand. But when a new ceiling appears in his basement?a ceiling that appears to have the ability to repair television sets so they?re better than before?he knows he has come up against a mystery that no man can solve. ? Winner of the Hugo Award for Best Novelette, ?The Big Front Yard? is a powerful story about what happens when an ordinary man finds reality coming apart around him. Along with the other stories in this collection, it is some of the most lyrical science fiction ever published. ? Each story includes an introduction by David W. Wixon, literary executor of the Clifford D. Simak estate and editor of this ebook.</p>

Her fans and friends ? and who didn?t adore, positively adore darling Mary? ? are heartbroken when somehow Mary manages to spritz herself not with her favorite perfume but with the deadly insecticide meant to be sprayed on the azaleas. Inspector Alleyn begins by smelling something fishy (everything he learns about lovely, fragile Mary suggests that in fact she was a rather vicious battleax), but he very quickly starts smelling something different?something like a rat.</p>

<p>Summary : Soffermati un istante a osservare la tua vita psichica: ? complessa, tumultuosa, spesso prepotente. Unica, forgiata dalla tua storia personale. Talvolta te ne senti sopraffatto. Hai mai pensato, per?, di imparare a interpretarla e a coglierne le dinamiche? Non ? facile, ma questa consapevolezza ? il primo passo per comprendere le tue emozioni e scoprire il tuo valore. Questo libro ? il primo delle due fondatrici di Psicoadvisor, la rivista online pi? seguita in Italia sui temi di psicologia e crescita personale ? propone un percorso introspettivo basato sulle pi? autorevoli teorie psicologiche, nel quale le autrici ti porteranno per mano a esplorare aspetti della tua personalit? che prima ignoravi. Dentro di te, sepolto sotto una coltre di emozioni soverchianti quali ansia, rabbia, sensi di colpa e insicurezza, c?? un inestimabile valore. Per riappropriartene, dovrai analizzare il tuo presente con un occhio attento al passato, ricostruendo i bisogni insoddisfatti e le aspettative </p>
