<p>Summary : Doing well with money isn&#8217;t necessarily about what you know. It&#8217;s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money&#8211;investing, personal finance, and business decisions&#8211;is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don&#8217;t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life&#8217;s most important topics.</p>

<p>Summary : </p>
<p>    People lived because she killed. People died because he lived.</p>
<p>Zafira is the Hunter, disguising herself as a man when she braves the cursed forest of the Arz to feed her people. Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the sultan. If Zafira was exposed as a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion, his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. Both Zafira and Nasir are legends in the kingdom of Arawiya?but neither wants to be.War is brewing, and the Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the sultan on a similar mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as their journey unfolds?and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either can imagine. Set in a world </p>

<p>Summary : Ganador del premio Orbetello 2023?Cuando vuelvas yo ya no estar?.? Son las ?ltimas palabras que Matteo B. Bianchi oye en boca de S., poco despu?s de separarse tras siete a?os de noviazgo. Parecen banales, pero son una despedida definitiva. Apenas unas horas despu?s, al regresar a casa, Bianchi encuentra su cad?ver. Por lo general, la literatura ha abordado el tema del suicidio desde el punto de vista de los que se quitan la vida, sin prestar atenci?n a sus seres queridos, ?supervivientes? sumidos en una vor?gine de rabia, culpa y verg?enza. Ahora Bianchi es uno de ellos. Tras acudir a psiquiatras, visitar a videntes e intentar buscar consuelo en los libros, el autor descubre una verdad inc?moda: quienes sobreviven no cuentan con un lenguaje apto para verbalizar su experiencia. Nadie puede comprenderlos. As? que toma apuntes, primero de memoria y luego por escrito, para dar forma a su dolor. El resultado es este libro, parte di?logo ?ntimo con S., parte recuento de un amor magn?tico y </p>

E quanto aos homens: por que n?o apenas evitam a experi?ncia amorosa, como tamb?m s?o ridicularizados quando se apaixonam? Por que o trabalho ocupa um lugar t?o central em suas vidas, assim como a sexualidade ativa, marcada sobretudo pela ideia de quantidade (?quantas comeu??)?. Para explicar essas quest?es, relacionadas ?s hierarquias de g?nero, Valeska Zanello prop?e a met?fora da prateleira do amor. A imagem da prateleira explicita a profunda diferen?a qualitativa e de investimento que o amor rom?ntico tem para mulheres e homens. Para elas, trata-se de algo identit?rio, motivo pelo qual persistem mesmo em rela??es abusivas. Para eles, trata-se de fonte inesgot?vel de lucro afetivo.</p>

<p>Summary : Winner of the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing, Rajiv Mohabir?s Antiman is a stunning hybrid memoir that blends literary genres to tackle questions of caste, ethnicity, and sexuality, and to explore the author?s experiences as an Indo-Guyanese queer poet and immigrant to the United States.Born in London to Guyanese Indian parents and immigrating to the United States when he was a toddler, Rajiv Mohabir?s familial history is one of displacement and constant migration. His great grandparents were indentured laborers who worked on British sugar plantations after the (official) abolition of the slave trade in 1834. In South America, his parents were forced into Christianity and colonial education before moving to England.

<p>Summary : Winner of the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing, Rajiv Mohabir?s Antiman is a stunning hybrid memoir that blends literary genres to tackle questions of caste, ethnicity, and sexuality, and to explore the author?s experiences as an Indo-Guyanese queer poet and immigrant to the United States.Born in London to Guyanese Indian parents and immigrating to the United States when he was a toddler, Rajiv Mohabir?s familial history is one of displacement and constant migration. His great grandparents were indentured laborers who worked on British sugar plantations after the (official) abolition of the slave trade in 1834. In South America, his parents were forced into Christianity and colonial education before moving to England. After growing up in Indian immigrant communities in the US, Mohabir is inspired by his own blended identity to approach his experiences in multiple genres.Full of poetry, prose in distinctive dialects, myth, and family lore, Antiman is a song cycle in </p>

<p>Summary : Wied?mi?ski kodeks stawia t? spraw? w spos?b jednoznaczny: wied?minowi smoka zabija? si? nie godzi. To gatunek zagro?ony wymarciem. Aczkolwiek w powszechnej opinii to gad najbardziej wredny. Na oszluzgi, wid?ogony i latawce kodeks polowa? przyzwala. Ale na smoki ? nie. Wied?min Geralt przy??cza si? jednak do zorganizowanej przez kr?la Niedamira wyprawy na smoka, kt?ry skry? si? w jaskiniach G?r Pustulskich. Na swej drodze spotyka trubadura Jaskra oraz ? jak?eby inaczej ? czarodziejk? Yennefer.

<p>Summary : In volumes ten and eleven of The History of Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien recounts from the original texts the evolution of his father&#8217;s work on The Silmarillion, the legendary history of the Elder Days or First Age, from the completion of the Lord of the Rings in 1949 until J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s death. In volume ten, Morgoth&#8217;s Ring, the narrative was taken only as far as the natural dividing point in the work, when Morgoth destroyed the Trees of Light and fled from Valinor bearing the stolen Silmarils. In The War of the Jewels, the story returns to Middle-earth and the ruinous conflict of the High Elves and the Men who were their allies with the power of the Dark Lord. With the publication in this book of all of J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s later narrative writing concerned with the last centuries of the First Age, the long history of The Silmarillion, from its beginnings in The Book of Lost Tales, is completed; the enigmatic state of the work at his death can now be understood.

<p>Summary : In volumes ten and eleven of The History of Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien recounts from the original texts the evolution of his father&#8217;s work on The Silmarillion, the legendary history of the Elder Days or First Age, from the completion of the Lord of the Rings in 1949 until J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s death. In volume ten, Morgoth&#8217;s Ring, the narrative was taken only as far as the natural dividing point in the work, when Morgoth destroyed the Trees of Light and fled from Valinor bearing the stolen Silmarils. In The War of the Jewels, the story returns to Middle-earth and the ruinous conflict of the High Elves and the Men who were their allies with the power of the Dark Lord. With the publication in this book of all of J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s later narrative writing concerned with the last centuries of the First Age, the long history of The Silmarillion, from its beginnings in The Book of Lost Tales, is completed; the enigmatic state of the work at his death can now be understood.

<p>Summary : We&#8217;ve needlessly turned parenting into an unpleasant chore. Parents invest more time and money in their kids than ever, but the shocking lesson of twin and adoption research is that upbringing is much less important than genetics in the long run. These revelations have surprising implications for how we parent and how we spend time with our kids. The big lesson: Mold your kids less and enjoy your life more. Your kids will still turn out fine.Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids is a book of practical big ideas. How can parents be happier? What can they change&#8211;and what do they need to just accept? Which of their worries can parents safely forget? Above all, what is the right number of kids for you to have? You&#8217;ll never see kids or parenthood the same way again.</p>

Contemplating his own mortality for the first time, Travis McGee discovers amid all the danger the astonishing surprise behind the cat-shaped pipe cleaners someone is leaving at his door.

<p>Summary : El 2 de julio de 2022, dos delincuentes se disponen a robar en una importante joyer?a de Ginebra. Un incidente que dista mucho de ser un vulgar atraco. Veinte d?as antes, en una lujosa urbanizaci?n a orillas del lago Lem?n, Sophie Braun se prepara para celebrar su cuadrag?simo cumplea?os. La vida le sonr?e: vive con su familia en una mansi?n rodeada de bosques, pero su id?lico mundo est? a punto de tambalearse. Su marido anda enredado en sus peque?os secretos. Su vecino, un polic?a de reputaci?n irreprochable, se ha obsesionado con ella y la esp?a hasta en los detalles m?s ?ntimos. Y un misterioso merodeador le hace un regalo que pone su vida en peligro. Ser?n necesarios varios viajes al pasado, lejos de Ginebra, para hallar el origen de esta intriga diab?lica de la que nadie saldr? indemne.</p>

<p>Summary : In her groundbreaking and essential debut The Three Mothers, scholar Anna Malaika Tubbs celebrates Black motherhood by telling the story of the three women who raised and shaped some of America&#8217;s most pivotal heroes: Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and James Baldwin.Much has been written about Berdis Baldwin&#8217;s son James, about Alberta King&#8217;s son Martin Luther, and Louise Little&#8217;s son Malcolm. But virtually nothing has been said about the extraordinary women who raised them, who were all born at the beginning of the 20th century and forced to contend with the prejudices of Jim Crow as Black women.Berdis, Alberta, and Louise passed their knowledge to their children with the hope of helping them to survive in a society that would deny their humanity from the very beginning&#8211;from Louise teaching her children about their activist roots, to Berdis encouraging James to express himself through writing, to Alberta basing all of her lessons in faith and social justice.

It&#8217;s thrilling beyond belief. It&#8217;s everything you&#8217;d expect of someone worthy to be called Lord. The choice is yours to know him as only a water-walker can, aligning yourself with God&#8217;s purpose for your life in the process.

<p>Summary : Winner of the 2002 Christianity Today Book Award! You&#8217;re One Step Away from the Adventure of Your Life Deep within you lies the same faith and longing that sent Peter walking across the wind-swept Sea of Galilee toward Jesus. In what ways is the Lord telling you, as he did Peter, &#8220;Come&#8221;? John Ortberg invites you to consider the incredible potential that awaits you outside your comfort zone. Out on the risky waters of faith, Jesus is waiting to meet you in ways that will change you forever, deepening your character and your trust in God. The experience is terrifying. It&#8217;s thrilling beyond belief. It&#8217;s everything you&#8217;d expect of someone worthy to be called Lord. The choice is yours to know him as only a water-walker can, aligning yourself with God&#8217;s purpose for your life in the process. There&#8217;s just one requirement: If You Want to Walk on Water, You&#8217;ve Got to Get Out of the Boat.</p>

<p>Summary : This handbook is designed for all language teachers who are giving one-to-one lessons, either in person or as part of a distance learning programme. It helps teachers take advantage of the opportunities of one-to-one teaching, and also cope with its challenges. Part 1 provides practical guidelines on teaching individual learners, and looks at the roles a one-to-one teacher may have, such as &#8216;conversation partner&#8217; or &#8216;observer and listener&#8217;. A focus on these roles keeps interactions in lessons varied and offers ways to develop your teaching skills. Part 2 contains easy-to-use activities, through which both teacher and learner can focus on the language the learner wants to learn. Many of the activities include ideas for using technology and online resources, which can help to develop language skills as well as being fun to use. The accompanying CD-ROM provides material which can be printed out and photocopied for use in lessons.</p>

<p>Summary : Afghan-American Nadia Hashimi&#8217;s literary debut novel is a searing tale of powerlessness, fate, and the freedom to control one&#8217;s own fate that combines the cultural flavor and emotional resonance of the works of Khaled Hosseini, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Lisa See.In Kabul, 2007, with a drug-addicted father and no brothers, Rahima and her sisters can only sporadically attend school, and can rarely leave the house. Their only hope lies in the ancient custom of bacha posh, which allows young Rahima to dress and be treated as a boy until she is of marriageable age. As a son, she can attend school, go to the market, and chaperone her older sisters.But Rahima is not the first in her family to adopt this unusual custom. A century earlier, her great-great grandmother, Shekiba, left orphaned by an epidemic, saved herself and built a new life the same way.Crisscrossing in time, The Pearl the Broke Its Shell interweaves the tales of these two women separated by a century who share similar destinies. </p>

<p>Summary : An orphan.An outcast.A prince.And a killer who will bring an empire to its knees.Growing up in the Kegari slums, AIZ has seen her share of suffering. An old tragedy fuels her need for vengeance, but it is love of her people that propels her. Until one hotheaded mistake lands her in an inescapable prison, where the embers of her wrath ignite.Banished from her people for an unforgivable crime, SIRSHA is a down-on-her-luck tracker who uses magic to trace her marks. Destitute, she agrees to hunt down a killer who has murdered children across the Martial Empire. All she has to do is carry out the job and get paid. But when a chance encounter leads to an unexpected attraction, Sirsha learns her mission might cost her far more than she&#8217;s willing to give up. QUIL is the crown prince of the Empire and nephew of a venerated empress, but he?s loath to take the throne when his aunt steps down. As the son of a reviled emperor, he, better than anyone, understands that power corrupts. When a </p>

<p>Summary : Bj?rn Diemel ist zur?ck ? und mordet ganzheitlicher als je zuvor.Bj?rn Diemel hat die Prinzipien der Achtsamkeit erlernt, und mit ihrer Hilfe sein Leben verbessert. Er hat den stressigen Job gek?ndigt und sich selbstst?ndig gemacht. Er verbringt mehr Zeit mit seiner Tochter und streitet sich in der Regel liebevoller mit seiner Frau. Ach ja, und nebenbei f?hrt er noch ganz entspannt zwei Mafia-Clans, weil er den Chef des einen ermordet und den des anderen im Keller eines Kindergartens eingekerkert hat. Warum nur kann Bj?rn das alles nicht genie?en? Warum verliert er st?ndig die Beherrschung? Hat er das Morden einfach satt? Ganz so einfach ist es nicht. Sein Therapeut Joschka Breitner bringt ihn endlich auf die richtige Spur: Es liegt an Bj?rns innerem Kind!</p>

<p>Summary : Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.</p>

<p>Summary : Oscar-nominated screenwriter, director, and actor Sarah Polley&#8217;s Run Towards the Danger explores memory and the dialogue between her past and her presentThese are the most dangerous stories of my life. The ones I have avoided, the ones I haven&#8217;t told, the ones that have kept me awake on countless nights.

Each one captures a piece of Polley&#8217;s life as she remembers it, while at the same time examining the fallibility of memory, the mutability of reality in the mind, and the possibility of experiencing the past anew, as the person she is now but was not then. As Polley writes, the past and present are in a &#8220;reciprocal </p>

<p>Summary : From the National Book Award?winning author of All That She Carried, an intimate and revelatory reckoning with the myth and the truth behind an American everyone knows and few really understandHarriet Tubman is, if surveys are to be trusted, one of the ten most famous Americans ever born and soon to be the face of the twenty-dollar bill. Yet often she?s a figure more out of myth than history, almost a comic-book superhero?the woman who, despite being barely five feet tall, illiterate, and suffering from a brain injury, managed to escape from her own enslavement, return again and again to lead others north to freedom without loss of life, speak out powerfully against slavery, and then become the first American woman in history to lead a military raid, freeing some 750 people. You could almost say she?s America?s Robin Hood, a miraculous vision, often rightly celebrated but seldom understood. Tiya Miles?s extraordinary Night Flyer changes all that. With her characteristic tenderness </p>

<p>Summary : Coaching is an essential skill for leaders. But for most busy, overworked managers, coaching employees is done badly, or not at all.? They?re just too busy, and it?s too hard to change. But what if managers could coach their people in 10 minutes or less? In Michael Bungay Stanier?s The Coaching Habit,?coaching becomes a regular, informal part of your day so managers and their teams can work less hard and have more impact. Coaching is an art and it?s far easier said than done. It takes courage to ask a question rather than offer up advice, provide an answer, or unleash a solution. Giving another person the opportunity to find their own way, make their own mistakes, and create their own wisdom is both brave and vulnerable. It can also mean unlearning our ?fix it??habits. In this practical and inspiring book, Michael shares seven transformative questions that can make a difference in how we lead and support. And, he guides us through the tricky part &#8211; how to take this new information </p>

As she stretches canvases until her fingers blister; talks her way into A-list parties full of billionaire collectors; </p>

<p>Summary : 15 hours, 22 minutes A teenager explores the darkness hidden within his hometown in this spellbinding supernatural thriller from bestselling author Scott Carson.For a sixteen-year-old, a summer internship working for a private investigator seems like a dream come true?particularly since the PI is investigating the most shocking crime to hit Bloomington, Indiana, in decades. A local woman has vanished, and the last time anyone saw her, she was in the backseat of a police car driven by a man impersonating an officer.Marshall Miller?s internship puts him at the center of the action, a position he relishes until a terrifying moment that turns public praise for his sharp observations and uncanny memory into accusations of lying and imperiling the case. His detective mentor withdraws, friends and family worry and whisper, and Marshall alone understands that the darkness visiting his town this summer goes far beyond a single crime. Now his task is to explain it?and himself.Lost Man&#8217;s Lane </p>

<p>Summary : Ryan Serhant is the very confident guy who wears stellar suits, has a driver, and regularly closes seven-figure deals on Bravo&#8217;s hit series Million Dollar Listing: New York. On his reality show Sell It Like Serhant, he uses his sales expertise to teach struggling salespeople to successfully sell everything from golf balls to hot tubs. In this book is the blueprint for how to go from sales scrub to sales machine. Serhant was a jobless hand model when he entered real estate. He outlines exactly how he flipped the switch and grew to dominate one of the most competitive sales markets in the world. Using personal accounts and lessons from his biggest (and smallest) deals, he gives fresh insight on how to manage multiple balls, or goals, at once to increase profits and achieve ultimate success. A salesman should not live or die by one deal or client. The ultimate salesperson never closes a deal and wonders, &#8220;What now?&#8221; because the next deal should already be happening.

<p>Summary : <br />
  At seventeen, Lenora HopeHung her sister with a rope <br />
Now reduced to a schoolyard chant, the Hope family murders shocked the Maine coast one bloody night in 1929. While most people assume seventeen-year-old Lenora was responsible, the police were never able to prove it. Other than her denial after the killings, she has never spoken publicly about that night, nor has she set foot outside Hope?s End, the cliffside mansion where the massacre occurred. <br />
  Stabbed her father with a knifeTook her mother?s happy life <br />
It?s now 1983, and home-health aide Kit McDeere arrives at a decaying Hope?s End to care for Lenora after her previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. In her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, Lenora was rendered mute by a series of strokes and can only communicate with Kit by tapping out sentences on an old typewriter. One night, Lenora uses it to make a tantalizing offer?I want to tell you everything. <br />
  ?It wasn?t me,? Lenora saidBut she?s the only one not dead

<p>Summary : Camille doet niets liever dan zingen! Ze barst van het talent &#8211; maar nog veel belangrijker &#8211; ze is bereid om keihard te werken voor de muziekcarri?re waar ze altijd van gedroomd heeft. Ze deelt haar passie met haar familie, vrienden en haar allerliefste kat Moustache. Camille oefent voor haar toelatingsexamen bij de showbizzschool. De eerste stap om een succesvolle zangeres te worden. Er is alleen ??n klein probleem: ze is haar middelbareschooldiploma kwijt! Zonder dit bewijs kan ze zich niet inschrijven voor een auditie en valt haar droom in duigen. Volgens de schooldirecteur is er maar ??n oplossing, ze moet terug naar school om alle testen over te doen. Maar wat Camille niet weet, is dat de directeur een verborgen agenda heeft?</p>

<p>Summary : Bataille&#8217;s first novel, published under the pseudonym &#8216;Lord Auch&#8217;, is still his most notorious work. In this explicit pornographic fantasy, the young male narrator and his lovers Simone and Marcelle embark on a sexual quest involving sadism, torture, orgies, madness and defilement, culminating in a final act of transgression. Shocking and sacrilegious, Story of the Eye is the fullest expression of Bataille&#8217;s obsession with the closeness of sex, violence and death. Yet it is also hallucinogenic in its power, and is one of the erotic classics of the twentieth century. This edition also includes Susan Sontag&#8217;s superb study of pornography as art, &#8216;The Pornographic Imagination&#8217;, as well as Roland Barthes&#8217; essay &#8216;The Metaphor of the Eye&#8217;.Georges Bataille (1897-1962), French essayist and novelist, was born in Billom, France. He converted to Catholicism, then later to Marxism, and was interested in psychoanalysis and mysticism, forming a secret society dedicated to glorifying human </p>

<p>Summary : For out-starting upstarts of all ages, here is a wonderfully wise and blessedly brief graduation speech from the one and only Dr. Seuss!In his inimitable, humorous verse and pictures, he addresses the Great Balancing Act (life itself, and the ups and downs it presents) while encouraging us to find the success that lies within us.&#8221;And will you succeed?Yes! You will indeed!(98 and ? percent guaranteed.)&#8221;A modern classic, Oh, the Places You&#8217;ll Go! was first published one year before Dr. Seuss&#8217;s death at the age of eighty-seven. In a mere fifty-six pages, Dr, Seuss managed to impart a lifetime of wisdom. It is the perfect send-off for children starting out in the maze of life, be they nursery school grads or newly-minted PhD&#8217;s. Everyone will find it inspired good fun.With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years.

<p>Summary : An artistic collection of more than 50 drawings featuring unique, funny, and poignant foreign words that have no direct translation into English. Did you know that the Japanese language has a word to?express the way sunlight filters through the leaves of trees? Or that there?s a Finnish word for the distance a reindeer?can travel before needing to rest??Lost in Translation brings to life more than fifty words that?don?t have direct English translations with charming illustrations?of their tender, poignant, and humorous definitions. Often?these words provide insight into the cultures they come from,?such as the Brazilian Portuguese word for running your fingers through a lover?s hair, the Italian word for being moved to tears by a story, or the Swedish word for a third cup of coffee. In this clever and beautifully rendered exploration of the?subtleties of communication, you?ll find new ways to express yourself while getting lost in the artistry of imperfect translation.</p>

<p>Summary : Every day, we make decisions on topics ranging from personal investments to schools for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. The reason, the authors explain, is that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself.Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think, we can design choice environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful ?choice architecture? can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without </p>

<p>Summary : Within every woman, there lives a powerful force, filled with good instincts, passionate creativity, and ageless knowing. She is the Wild Woman, who represents the instinctual nature of women. But she is an endangered species. For though the gifts of wildish nature belong to us at birth, society&#8217;s attempt to &#8220;civilize&#8221; us into rigid roles has muffled the deep, life-giving messages of our own souls. In &#8220;Women Who Run With the Wolves,&#8221; Dr Estes unfolds rich intercultural myths, fairytales and stories, many from her own family, in order to help women reconnect with the fierce, healthy, visionary attributes of this instinctual nature. Through the stories and commentaries in this remarkable book, we retrieve, examine, love, and understand the Wild Woman, and hold her against our deep psyches as one who is both magic and medicine. Dr Estes has created a new lexicon for describing the female psyche. Fertile and life-giving, it is a psychology of women in the truest sense, a knowing of the </p>

<p>Summary : The unflinching and unforgettable memoir of music and life from the much-loved Australian legend.From a childhood in London and Melbourne through to pop stardom in the 1960s, the critical success enjoyed with the release of the highest-selling Australian album of all time, Whispering Jack, and a decades-long touring career, the John Farnham story is, at first glance, one filled with remarkable highlights.It is, however, so much more than that. It is the story of the resilience John found as his stellar career stalled, record companies turned their backs, and he faced financial ruin. It is the story of triumph over adversity after a devastating diagnosis of mouth cancer in 2022, only months after the death of his long-time friend and manager, Glenn Wheatley.Throughout a lifetime filled with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, John has remained steadfast, never losing his unique musical talent, creative strength nor his powerful ability to make human connections through his </p>

<p>Summary : MURTAGH transports readers into an electrifying adventure, with danger and intrigue around every corner. The world is no longer safe for the Dragon Rider Murtagh and his dragon, Thorn. An evil king has been toppled, and they are left to face the consequences of the reluctant role they played in his reign of terror. Now they are hated and alone, exiled to the outskirts of society. But when Murtagh discovers something wicked lurking in the shadows of Alaga?sia, so begins an epic journey into lands both familiar and untraveled, where he and Thorn must use every weapon in their arsenal, from brains to brawn, to find and outwit a mysterious witch. A witch who is much more than she seems . . .</p>

<p>Summary : The great Austrian writer Stefan Zweig was a master anatomist of the deceitful heart, and Impatience of the Heart, the only novel he published during his lifetime, uncovers the seed of selfishness within even the finest of feelings.Hofmiller, an Austro-Hungarian cavalry officer stationed at the edge of the empire, is invited to a party at the home of a rich local landowner, a world away from the dreary routine of the barracks. The surroundings are glamorous, wine flows freely, and the exhilarated young Hofmiller asks his host&#8217;s lovely daughter for a dance, only to discover that sickness has left her painfully crippled. It is a minor blunder that will destroy his life, as pity and guilt gradually implicate him in a well-meaning but tragically wrongheaded plot to restore the unhappy invalid to health.</p>

<p>Summary : 9 hours, 43 minutes An overworked book publicist with a perfectly planned future hits a snag when she falls in love with her temporary roommate&#8230;only to discover he lives seven years in the past, in this witty and wise new novel from the New York Times bestselling author of The Dead Romantics.Sometimes, the worst day of your life happens, and you have to figure out how to live after it.So Clementine forms a plan to keep her heart safe: work hard, find someone decent to love, and try to remember to chase the moon.

<p>Summary : When award-winning actor, producer and international icon Gabriel Byrne was a young boy, his grandmother brought him to the cinema for the first time. There, Byrne fell in love with the transporting power of the big screen. Growing up in 1950s and 60s Dublin within a family of eight, Byrne&#8217;s formative childhood years were both carefree and challenging, spent between home, the church, school, and the streets of his ever-changing city where he observed that some of the greatest actors and entertainers could be found in the lives of those around him. In captivating, funny, and sensual prose that brings to life the myriad voices of his youth, Byrne recounts his first formative 12 years &#8211; morning routines with his father, a barrel-maker at the Guinness factory; his debut role in a nativity play; his relationship with his dynamic mother; and his years at a seminary where he studied to be a priest. Interspersed throughout this engrossing childhood story we see Byrne&#8217;s ascent to global </p>

<p>Summary : 11 hours, 42 minutes A hilarious love story about a disillusioned divorc?e who agrees to let her children play matchmaker.Columnist Anna Appleby has left her love life behind after a painful divorce. Who needs a man when she has two kids, a cat, and uncontested control of the TV remote? Besides, she?d rather be single than subject herself to the hell of online dating. But her office rival is vying for her column, and no column means no stable source of income. In a desperate attempt to keep her job, Anna finds herself pitching a unique angle: seven dates, all found offline, chosen by her children.From awkward encounters to unexpected connections, Anna gamely begins to put herself out there, asking out waiters, the mailman, and even her celebrity crush. But when a romantic connection appears where she least expected it, will she be brave enough to take another chance on love?</p>
