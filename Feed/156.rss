<p>Summary : Behavioral scientist Alison Fragale offers powerful new insights and a practical playbook for women to advance in any workplace, full of tips, tricks, and strategies to help secure that elusive corner office.Over decades of research, speaking engagements, and mentorship, psychologist and professor Alison Fragale encountered recurring questions from high powered and early career women: How do women thread the needle of kindness and competence in the workplace? How can women earn credit for their accomplishments, negotiate better, and navigate complex office politics without losing the goodwill of their peers?Fragale investigated and determined that many women&#8217;s workplace issues boil down to the perception of others. No degree, title, or paycheck will raise a woman&#8217;s workplace stature unless it also affects how other people respect and regard her.

<p>Summary : Dante ? il poeta che invent? l&#8217;Italia. Non ci ha dato soltanto una lingua; ci ha dato soprattutto un&#8217;idea di noi stessi e del nostro Paese: il ?bel Paese? dove si dice ?s?. Una terra unita dalla cultura e dalla bellezza, destinata a un ruolo universale: perch? raccoglie l&#8217;eredit? dell&#8217;Impero romano e del mondo classico; ed ? la culla della cristianit? e dell&#8217;umanesimo. L&#8217;Italia non nasce da una guerra o dalla diplomazia; nasce dai versi di Dante. Non solo. Dante ? il poeta delle donne. ? solo grazie alla donna &#8211; scrive &#8211; se la specie umana supera qualsiasi cosa contenuta nel cerchio della luna, vale a dire sulla Terra. La donna ? il capolavoro di Dio, la meraviglia del creato; e Beatrice, la donna amata, per Dante ? la meraviglia delle meraviglie. Sar? lei a condurlo alla salvezza. Ma il poeta ha parole straordinarie anche per le donne infelicemente innamorate, e per le vite spente dalla violenza degli uomini: come quella di Francesca da Rimini.

<p>Summary : For thirty years, Area X has remained mysterious, remote, and concealed by the government as an environmental disaster zone even though it is to all appearances pristine wilderness. For thirty years, too, the secret agency known as the Southern Reach has monitored Area X and sent in expeditions to try to discover the truth. Some expeditions have suffered terrible consequences. Others have reported nothing out of the ordinary. Now, as Area X seems to be changing and perhaps expanding, the next expedition will attempt to succeed where all others have failed. What is happening in Area X? What is the true nature of the invisible border that surrounds it?Annihilation tells the story of the twelfth expedition through the narration of a nameless biologist attached to the mission. A reticent, solitary woman, the biologist brings her own personal secrets with her. She is accompanied by a psychologist, anthropologist, and surveyor, their stated mission to chart the wilderness, take samples, </p>

For thirty years, too, the secret agency known as the Southern Reach has monitored Area X and sent in expeditions to try to discover the truth. Some expeditions have suffered terrible consequences.

<p>Summary : <br />
  You have been selected to attend Zodiac Academy, where your star sign defines your destiny. <br />
If you&#8217;re one of the Fae, elemental magic is in your blood. And apparently it&#8217;s in ours. As twins born in the month of Gemini, we&#8217;re a rare breed even in this academy of supernatural a-holes.Changelings were outlawed hundreds of years ago but I guess our birth parents didn&#8217;t get the memo. Which means we&#8217;re totally unprepared for the ruthless world of Fae.Air. Fire. Water. Earth.No one has ever harnessed all four of them, until we arrived. And it hasn&#8217;t made us any friends so far.As the rarest Elementals ever known, we&#8217;re already a threat to the four celestial heirs; the popular, vindictive bullies who happen to be some of the hottest guys we&#8217;ve ever seen. It doesn&#8217;t help that they&#8217;re the most dangerous beasts in the Academy. And probably on earth too.Our fates are intertwined, but they want us gone. They&#8217;ve only got until the lunar eclipse to force us out and they&#8217;ll stop at nothing to </p>

<p>Summary : A daughter returns home to the Navajo reservation to confront her family&#8217;s troubled history and retrace her mother&#8217;s life?using both narrative and archive in this unforgettable and heart-wrenching memoir.After Danielle Geller&#8217;s mother dies of a withdrawal from alcohol during a period of homelessness, she is forced to return to Florida. Using her training as a librarian and archivist, Geller collects her mother&#8217;s documents, diaries, and photographs into a single suitcase and begins on a journey of confronting her family&#8217;s history and the decisions she&#8217;s been forced to make, a journey that will end at her mother&#8217;s home: the Navajo reservation. Geller masterfully intertwines wrenching prose with archival documents to create a deeply moving narrative of loss and inheritance that pays homage to our pasts, traditions, heritage, the family we are given, and the family we choose.</p>

<p>Summary : * Duration: 14 hours and 39 minutes *Secrets and lies&#8230;I?ve lived the entirety of my life wrapped up in subterfuge for one purpose: revenge.Through the years, I lived more as an enigma than a man. For so long, I denied I had a beating heart of my own. Until her. Until she unearthed the starving vessel inside, forced me to acknowledge it, forced me to understand that I?m capable of bleeding the same as any other. For that, we paid. We&#8217;re still paying. Yet, she demands it still, the useless heart of the ruthless thief and shameless villain she fell for. My fear is, I?m no longer that man. With the lies I?ve told, the life I?ve led, my mistakes are beginning to catch up with me, day by day, one by one. This is my last chance, and I have no intention of losing her again, but as the deception of my past starts to unravel and close in, shedding my humanity may be the only thing that can save us both. Maybe it?s already too late.The Ravenhood trilogy is a gritty modern-day take on

<p>Summary : In this explosive tell-all memoir, an Olympic medalist offers an unprecedented look inside the pressure-packed world of figure skating and reveals her battle to survive mental illness, eating disorders, and crippling perfectionism.When Gracie Gold stepped onto center stage (or ice, rather) as America?s sweetheart at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, she instantly became the face of America?s most beloved winter sport. Beautiful, blonde, Midwestern, and media-trained, she was suddenly being?written up everywhere from The New Yorker to Teen Vogue to People and baking cookies with Taylor Swift.?But little did the public know what Gracie was facing when the cameras were off. In 2017, she entered treatment for what was publicly announced as eating disorder and anxiety treatment, but what was, in reality, suicidal ideation. While Gracie?s public star was rising, her private life was falling Cracks within her family were widening, her bulimia was getting worse, and she became a survivor of sexual </p>

<p>Summary : The extraordinary life of Cher can be told by only one person . . . Cher herself.After more than seventy years of fighting to live her life on her own terms, Cher finally reveals her true story in intimate detail, in a two-part memoir.Her remarkable career is unique and unparalleled. The only woman to top Billboard charts in seven consecutive decades, she is the winner of an Academy Award, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Cannes Film Festival Award, and an inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who has been lauded by the Kennedy Center.She is a lifelong activist and philanthropist.As a dyslexic child who dreamed of becoming famous, Cher was raised in often-chaotic circumstances, surrounded by singers, actors, and a mother who inspired her in spite of their difficult relationship.With her trademark honesty and humor, Cher: The Memoir traces how this diamond in the rough succeeded with no plan and little confidence to become the trailblazing superstar the world has been unable to ignore </p>

<p>Summary : Woodrow Wilson Nickel, age 105, feels his life ebbing away. But when he learns giraffes are going extinct, he finds himself recalling the unforgettable experience he cannot take to his grave.It?s 1938. The Great Depression lingers. Hitler is threatening Europe, and world-weary Americans long for wonder. They find it in two giraffes who miraculously survive a hurricane while crossing the Atlantic. What follows is a twelve-day road trip in a custom truck to deliver Southern California?s first giraffes to the San Diego Zoo. Behind the wheel is the young Dust Bowl rowdy Woodrow. Inspired by true events, the tale weaves real-life figures with fictional ones, including the world?s first female zoo director, a crusty old man with a past, a young female photographer with a secret, and assorted reprobates as spotty as the giraffes.Part adventure, part historical saga, and part coming-of-age love story, West with Giraffes explores what it means to be changed by the grace of animals, the </p>

<p>Summary : A New York Times Notable Book of 2012 Food, and in particular the lack of it, was central to the experience of World War II. In this richly detailed and engaging history, Lizzie Collingham establishes how control of food and its production is crucial to total war. How were the imperial ambitions of Germany and Japan &#8211; ambitions which sowed the seeds of war &#8211; informed by a desire for self-sufficiency in food production? How was the outcome of the war affected by the decisions that the Allies and the Axis took over how to feed their troops? And how did the distinctive ideologies of the different combatant countries determine their attitudes towards those they had to feed?Tracing the interaction between food and strategy, on both the military and home fronts, this gripping, original account demonstrates how the issue of access to food was a driving force within Nazi policy and contributed to the decision to murder hundreds of thousands of &#8216;useless eaters&#8217; in Europe.

<p>Summary : Building on the astonishing success of The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle presents listeners with an honest look at the current state of humanity: He implores us to see and accept that this state, which is based on an erroneous identification with the egoic mind, is one of dangerous insanity. Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one. In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly are, which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently think we are, and learn to live and breathe freely.</p>

In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly are, which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently think we are, and learn to live and breathe freely.</p>

<p>Summary : Building on the astonishing success of The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle presents listeners with an honest look at the current state of humanity: He implores us to see and accept that this state, which is based on an erroneous identification with the egoic mind, is one of dangerous insanity. Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation.

<p>Summary : When my best friend?s little sister walks in on me moaning her name, it?s all over. All restraints are shattered, and every boundary demolished. Nothing will be the same?For years, I?ve tried to keep my distance from Dakota Cooper. She?s everything I?ve ever wanted and the one thing I can?t have.But when she calls me in the middle of the night after someone tries to break into her house, I can no longer handle that distance, and I convince her to stay with me, along with her young son.I should have known having her living under my roof would push me to the edge. Ignite the need that has simmered for so long.The problem is, she?s forbidden. Off-limits. And I know better than crossing that line.I can?t drag her into the dark secrets of my life.But I can?t stay away from her either, so I do the one thing I shouldn?t?I take.And now that I?ve had her, I?m not sure I can save her from who I am&#8230;What to expect in Don?t Forget Me Tomorrow&#8230;*Brother?s best friend*Single mom*Small town </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;After pumping eight blasts from a sawed-off shotgun at a group of rival gang members, twelve-year-old Kody Scott was initiated into the L.A. gang the Crips. He quickly matured into one of the most formidable Crip combat soldiers, earning the name ?Monster? for committing acts of brutality and violence that repulsed even his fellow gang members. When the inevitable jail term confined him to a maximum-security cell, a complete political and personal transformation followed: from Monster to Sanyika Shakur, black nationalist, member of the New Afrikan Independence Movement, and crusader against the causes of gangsterism. In a document that has been compared to The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver?s Soul on Ice, Shakur makes palpable the despair and decay of America?s inner cities and gives eloquent voice to one aspect of the black ghetto experience today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : Three Powerfully Alluring Vampire MenAnd One Queen to Rule Them AllAll Mina ever wanted was to escape her father&#8217;s control. Half human, half vampire, she lived eternally torn between two worlds, never fully experiencing the pleasures of either?until her father chose her as the pawn in his latest political move, gifting her to the darkly powerful and dangerously seductive Malachi Zion.Malachi is not a vampire to be trifled with. He rules with an iron fist and has a reputation for the darkest of sins. But the longer Mina spends with him, the more she realizes he&#8217;s not the monster she first thought?and as fear bleeds into lust, then trust, then something more, Malachi opens Mina up to a world she never knew could be hers for the taking: including the love of Malachi&#8217;s two closest friends and companions.Now surrounded by all three men, the center of their shockingly seductive world, Mina may finally have the power to face down her father and take back the life?and crown?that by all </p>

<p>Summary : When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ?success? in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey?s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven?t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey?s model, or anyone else?s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and </p>

<p>Summary : Librarian&#8217;s note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned ?a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible.

<p>Summary : When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum&#8217;s classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?  Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.</p>

But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?  Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.</p>

<p>Summary : A stirring and powerful memoir from black cultural critic Rebecca Carroll recounting her painful struggle to overcome a completely white childhood in order to forge her identity as a black woman in America.Rebecca Carroll grew up the only black person in her rural New Hampshire town. Adopted at birth by artistic parents who believed in peace, love, and zero population growth, her early childhood was loving and idyllic?and yet she couldn?t articulate the deep sense of isolation she increasingly felt as she grew older. Everything changed when she met her birth mother, a young white woman, who consistently undermined Carroll?s sense of her blackness and self-esteem. Carroll?s childhood became harrowing, and her memoir explores the tension between the aching desire for her birth mother?s acceptance, the loyalty she feels toward her adoptive parents, and the search for her racial identity. As an adult, Carroll forged a path from city to city, struggling along the way with difficult </p>

<p>Summary : Mirror, Mirror . . .  Marquise Walker has vanished without a trace. There are few clues and much speculation on her sudden disappearance. But the truth is more terrifying than anyone can even imagine. . . .  On The Wall . . .  Maggie McCrae would do anything to find her identical twin sister&#8211;even if it means stepping into her unfamiliar shoes. Walking through Marquise&#8217;s wild, uninhibited life is a revelation for Maggie, proof that she knew very little about her twin&#8217;s darker side and her connection to the only man Maggie ever loved, Thane Walker. Now he&#8217;s the man she shouldn&#8217;t trust, a man who could be her best hope . . . or a cold-blooded killer. . . .   Who&#8217;s The Deadest Twin Of All?  The deeper Maggie digs, the more she is drawn into the web of her own past. . . . to a twisted family legacy of desperate deceit, betrayal, and revenge . . . each secret bringing her closer to a final, shocking truth&#8211;and to the identity of a killer who&#8217;s closer than she thinks. . . .</p>

<p>Summary : Robert Greene is a master guide for millions of readers, distilling ancient wisdom and philosophy into essential texts for seekers of power, understanding and mastery. Now he turns to the most important subject of all &#8211; understanding people&#8217;s drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves.We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people&#8217;s masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Dee Brown?s sparkling account of a momentous year in American history <br />
  In 1876, America was eager to celebrate its centenary, but questioned what might lie ahead. The American Republic had grown to four times its original population, and was in the midst of enormous changes. Industrialization was booming, and new energy sources were being used for fuel and power. People were suddenly less bound to agriculture, and there were revolutions in transportation and communication. It was a time of Indian wars, the first stirrings of the labor movement, and the burgeoning struggle form women?s and other civil rights. Historian Dee Brown takes the measure of America in a rare moment of reflection on the nation?s past, present, and future. ?The Year of the Century was one of Brown?s favorites among his works. In page-turning prose, he tells of a tumultuous era and of a young nation taking stock.?This ebook features an illustrated biography of Dee Brown including rare photos from the </p>

<p>Summary : To save his favorite newspaper, Nero Wolfe steps into the crossfire of a tabloid war.Master sleuth Nero Wolfe?s small circle of friends is limited to his assistant, Archie Goodwin; his chef, Fritz; and Lon Cohen, the head man at the New York Gazette. Cohen knows more about the city?s power structure than any man in Manhattan, and for years, he happily passed Wolfe information in return for the odd exclusive scoop. But now Cohen needs Wolfe?s help, for the Gazette is ailing and the vultures have begun to circle. Scottish newspaper magnate Ian MacLaren plans to gut the paper and turn it into a sex-filled conservative rag. Standing in his way is the company?s chief shareholder, Gazette heir Harriet Haverhill. But when the aged Ms. Haverhill dies in an apparent suicide, no one remains to resist the Scot?s advances except Wolfe. MacLaren may be fierce, but when the cause is just, Nero Wolfe knows how to play dirty too.</p>

<p>Summary : A turbulent romance meets harrowing medical mystery: the true story of the author&#8217;s twenty-year marriage defined by her husband&#8217;s chronic illness&#8211;and a testament to the endurance of loveEleanor met Aaron when she was just a teenager and he was working at a local record store&#8211;older, cool, experienced, and with an electric personality.

<p>Summary : In &#8220;Watching The English&#8221; anthropologist Kate Fox takes a revealing look at the quirks, habits and foibles of the English people. She puts the English national character under her anthropological microscope, and finds a strange and fascinating culture, governed by complex sets of unspoken rules and byzantine codes of behaviour. The rules of weather-speak. The ironic-gnome rule. The reflex apology rule. The paranoid-pantomime rule. Class indicators and class anxiety tests. The money-talk taboo and many more &#8230;Through a mixture of anthropological analysis and her own unorthodox experiments (using herself as a reluctant guinea-pig), Kate Fox discovers what these unwritten behaviour codes tell us about Englishness.</p>
