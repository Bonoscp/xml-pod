<p>Summary : Ele que o abismo viu ? uma das vers?es do mito de Gilg?mesh, a que ? atribu?da a Sin-l?qi-unn?nni (s?c. XIII a.C.), considerada a mais completa e importante dessa tradi??o ac?dia, preservada em tabuinhas de argila que foram descobertas entre 1872 e 2014. O texto, traduzido do ac?dio e anotado por Jacyntho Lins Brand?o, traz para o leitor brasileiro a mais ampla reconstru??o do poema, que ? o mais antigo registro liter?rio que conhecemos. Na tradi??o que remonta a mais de quatro mil anos, ele ? anterior a Homero, a Hes?odo e aos textos b?blicos. Nesse longo (e ainda fragment?rio) poema encontramos, j? elaborados de forma sofisticada, ideias, valores e leituras do mundo ? al?m de v?rios mitos que aparecer?o na tradi??o liter?ria posterior, como a cria??o do homem a partir da argila, o dil?vio e a constru??o de uma arca para salvar as criaturas, humanos e animais.</p>

<p>Summary : Jung, attraktiv, begabt und unabh?ngig: Das ist Mia Holl, eine Frau von drei?ig Jahren, die sich vor einem Schwurgericht verantworten muss. Zur Last gelegt wird ihr ein Zuviel an Liebe (zu ihrem Bruder), ein Zuviel an Verstand (sie denkt naturwissenschaftlich) und ein ?berma? an geistiger Unabh?ngigkeit. In einer Gesellschaft, in der die Sorge um den K?rper alle geistigen Werte verdr?ngt hat, reicht dies aus, um als gef?hrliches Subjekt eingestuft zu werden. Juli Zeh entwirft in Corpus Delicti das spannende Science-Fiction-Szenario einer Gesundheitsdiktatur irgendwann im 21. Jahrhundert, in der Gesundheit zur h?chsten B?rgerpflicht geworden ist.</p>

<p>Summary : Ares Lively non ? uno studente di Yale come tutti gli altri. Cresciuto tra le regole spietate e i giochi crudeli della famiglia Lively, ha imparato che fidarsi di qualcuno pu? costare caro. Dopo gli eventi del labirinto, il pericolo torna a incombere quando, davanti alla porta della sua stanza, trova un misterioso dado rosso a sette facce, tante quante le spietate sfide ideate da Urano e Gea per punire lui e i suoi fratelli. A ogni fatica superata, oscuri segreti sul suo passato sono pronti a emergere, continue minacce che potrebbero cambiare il destino dell&#8217;intera famiglia. Il rischio ? quello di fare del male a qualcuno a cui vuole bene, perch? ? questo lo scopo finale: trovare nuove pedine da sacrificare. Compresa Hell, l&#8217;enigmatica e affascinante vicina di stanza. La posta in gioco non ? mai stata cos? alta, e mentre gli avversari si avvicinano, Ares dovr? decidere se fare di tutto per proteggere chi ama o lasciarsi consumare dal caos. Il confine tra distruzione e redenzione ? </p>

<p>Summary : ?I am hard pressed to think of another book that can match the combination of practical insights and reading enjoyment.??Steven LevittGame theory means rigorous strategic thinking. It?s the art of anticipating your opponent?s next moves, knowing full well that your rival is trying to do the same thing to you. Though parts of game theory involve simple common sense, much is counterintuitive, and it can only be mastered by developing a new way of seeing the world. Using a diverse array of rich case studies?from pop culture, TV, movies, sports, politics, and history?the authors show how nearly every business and personal interaction has a game-theory component to it.

<p>Summary : ?I am hard pressed to think of another book that can match the combination of practical insights and reading enjoyment.??Steven LevittGame theory means rigorous strategic thinking. It?s the art of anticipating your opponent?s next moves, knowing full well that your rival is trying to do the same thing to you. Though parts of game theory involve simple common sense, much is counterintuitive, and it can only be mastered by developing a new way of seeing the world. Using a diverse array of rich case studies?from pop culture, TV, movies, sports, politics, and history?the authors show how nearly every business and personal interaction has a game-theory component to it. Mastering game theory will make you more successful in business and life, and this lively book is the key to that mastery.</p>

<p>Summary : When the world is still counting the cost of the Second World War and the Iron Curtain has closed, eleven-year-old Roland Baines&#8217;s life is turned upside down. 2,000 miles from his mother&#8217;s protective love, stranded at an unusual boarding school, his vulnerability attracts piano teacher Miss Miriam Cornell, leaving scars as well as a memory of love that will never fade. Now, when his wife vanishes, leaving him alone with his tiny son, Roland is forced to confront the reality of his restless existence. As the radiation from Chernobyl spreads across Europe, he begins a search for answers that looks deep into his family history and will last for the rest of his life.From the Suez Crisis to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fall of the Berlin Wall to the current pandemic and climate change, Roland sometimes rides with the tide of history, but more often struggles against it. Haunted by lost opportunities, he seeks solace through every possible means &#8211; music, literature, friends, sex, politics </p>

Admit it, you missed him.The demon that terrorized Gravity Falls is back from the great beyond to finally tell his side of the story in The Book of Bill, written by none other than Bill Cipher himself.Inside, Bill sheds light on his bizarre origins, his sinister effects on human history, the Pines family?s most embarrassing secrets, and the key to overthrowing the world (laid out in a handy step-by-step guide). This chaotic and beautifully illustrated tome contains baffling riddles, uncrackable ciphers, lost Journal 3 pages, ways to cheat death, the meaning of life, and a whole chapter on Silly Straws. But most importantly, The Book of Bill is deeply, deeply cursed.Beware: This book travels to dimensions meant for older readers.Alex Hirsch, #1 New York Times bestselling author, resuscitates this infamous villain and invites fans to a Bill?s eye view of the Gravity Falls universe. There are many who believe this book is too dangerous for human hands. But if you can?t </p>

<p>Summary : When Deputy Sam Brooks commits to something, nothing can sway him&#8211;not just on the job as liaison between the Mercy Falls sheriff&#8217;s department and PEAK Rescue, but in his private life. He&#8217;s the one who stuck around to take care of his mother after his father&#8217;s accidental death. And he&#8217;s the one&#8211;perhaps the only one&#8211;who believes Sierra Rose is the perfect girl for him. Safe, practical, and organized, she&#8217;s nothing like her hippie, impulsive, bleeding heart sister, Willow.Willow, however, has been in love with Sam Brooks for as long as she can remember. But she wants her sister to have a happy ending. Besides, Willow has other things to focus on&#8211;namely, nabbing the job as youth pastor for her small-town church. Best thing for her to do is to purge Sam from her heart.Neither can predict the events that will bring them together in a fight for their lives in the forbidding wilderness of Glacier National Park. Stranded, injured, and with the winter weather closing in, Sam and Willow </p>

<p>Summary : In this timeless guide on maximizing teams to achieve outstanding business success, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Who?s Got Your Back, and Never Eat Alone distills his years of experience coaching teams at Fortune 500 companies and startup unicorns to optimize team performance.The world?s best teams don?t win because of leadership alone. They win because of teamship. Yet when it comes to success, it is leaders who are lauded; too little attention is given to the transformation of the team itself.We?ve all but ignored how to extract billions of dollars of shareholder value from the interdependency of talent in teams, Keith Ferrazzi argues. Upgrading teams is one of the least curated and under-leveraged opportunities for success. It is time to focus on teamship.But first we must reinvent our understanding of what teamship is and how it functions in a work world that is significantly more volatile, networked, hybrid, diverse, and inclusive than even a decade ago.

<p>Summary : In this timeless guide on maximizing teams to achieve outstanding business success, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Who?s Got Your Back, and Never Eat Alone distills his years of experience coaching teams at Fortune 500 companies and startup unicorns to optimize team performance.The world?s best teams don?t win because of leadership alone. They win because of teamship. Yet when it comes to success, it is leaders who are lauded; too little attention is given to the transformation of the team itself.We?ve all but ignored how to extract billions of dollars of shareholder value from the interdependency of talent in teams, Keith Ferrazzi argues. Upgrading teams is one of the least curated and under-leveraged opportunities for success. It is time to focus on teamship.But first we must reinvent our understanding of what teamship is and how it functions in a work world that is significantly more volatile, networked, hybrid, diverse, and inclusive than even a decade ago.

<p>Summary : The last surviving witness to the lynching of Emmett Till tells his story, with moving recollections of Emmett as a boy, critical insights into the recent investigation, and powerful lessons for racial reckoning, both then and now. In 1955, Emmett Till was lynched when he was fourteen years old. That remains an undisputed fact of the case that ignited a flame within the Civil Rights Movement that has yet to be extinguished. Yet the rest of the details surrounding the event remain distorted by time and too many tellings. What does justice mean in the resolution of a cold case spanning nearly seven decades? In A Few Days Full of Trouble, this question drives a new perspective on the story of Emmett Till, relayed by his cousin and best friend?the Reverend Wheeler Parker Jr., a survivor of the night of terror when young Emmett was taken from his family?s rural Mississippi Delta home in the dead of night. In a hypnotic interplay between uncovered facts and vivid recall, Rev. Parker offers </p>

<p>Summary : A night spent sleeping on dirt and leaves is not how Claire Matchett expected to spend her vacation.She thought this would be a break from the stresses of work and raising her young children. A chance to repair her damaged marriage. A week of hiking and hot tubs with two other couple friends. It sounded like heaven.Then Claire?s minivan breaks down on a lonely dirt road. With no cell reception, the group has no choice but to hike the rest of the way to their hotel. But it turns out the woods aren?t as easy to navigate as they thought.Hours later, they are lost. Hopelessly lost.And as they navigate deeper into the woods, the members of their party are struck down mysteriously one by one. Has a wild animal been hunting them? Or is the hunter one of them?But as more time passes, one thing becomes clear: Only one of them will return home alive.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Una ragazza mi ferma nel cortile dell&#8217;universit?, mi parla della sua ansia, della paura di non essere all&#8217;altezza delle aspettative, piange silenziosamente e mi chiede come si pu? scegliere la strada.? Inizia da questa domanda il viaggio di Mario Calabresi in giro per l&#8217;Italia, alla ricerca delle storie di chi, attraverso la propria vita ordinaria e straordinaria, ? stato capace di trovare una via nelle incertezze. Tra questi incontri ci sono un ingegnere che raccoglie i suoni pi? antichi della natura per trasmetterli alle generazioni future, una poetessa che impara dal silenzio ad ascoltare il visibile e l&#8217;invisibile, un professore di filosofia che insegna a vedere i limiti come occasioni, e un centenario che per tutta la vita si ? preso cura di un bosco e ne ha ereditato il tempo. ? un percorso lento, di ascolto, alla ricerca di un luogo in cui l&#8217;attimo presente non sia fine a se stesso ma si mescoli con il passato e ci parli di futuro, e di un&#8217;et? in cui ?essere grati ? il primo </p>

<p>Summary : Soledad Barnes has her life all planned out. Because, of course, she does. She plans everything.?She designs everything. She?fixes?everything. She?s a domestic goddess who&#8217;s never met a party she couldn&#8217;t host or a charge she couldn&#8217;t lead. The one with all the answers and the perfect vinaigrette?for that summer salad. But none of her varied talents can save her when catastrophe strikes, and the life she built with the man who was supposed to be her forever, goes?poof?in a cloud of betrayal and disillusion. But there is no time to pout or sulk, or even grieve the life she lost.?She&#8217;s too?busy keeping a roof over her daughters&#8217; heads and food on the table.?And in the process of saving them all, Soledad rediscovers herself. From the ashes of a life burned to the ground, something bold and new can rise. But then an unlikely man enters the picture?the forbidden one, the one she shouldn&#8217;t want but can&#8217;t seem to resist. She&#8217;s lost it all before and refuses to repeat her?mistakes.

<p>Summary : SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2020 COSTA BOOK AWARDS. Named one of The Times &amp; The Observer&#8217;s Best Children&#8217;s Books of 2020. The islands of Lake Wranglestone are a safe haven in a world filled with the Restless Dead. But as the lake freezes over, there?s nothing to stop them from crossing the ice.Peter?s has never really felt at home in a place where practicality and grit are valued above all else. He?s nothing like rancher, Cooper, the boy he?s always watched from afar. But when he?s is ordered to join him out on the mainland to help herd the Dead from their shores, they find more than just each other. There they unearth a dark secret about Wranglestone?s past. One that forces the pair to question everything they?ve ever known. An action-packed and thought-provoking debut, for fans of Patrick Ness, Marcus Sedgwick, DREAD NATION and The Walking Dead.</p>

<p>Summary : From actor, comedian, co-creator of Marcel the Shell, and New York Times bestselling author of Little Weirds, Jenny Slate, a wild, soulful, hilarious collection of genre-bending essays depicting the journey into motherhood as you?ve never seen it beforeWhat happened was this: Jenny Slate was a human mammal who sniffed the air every morning hoping to find another person to love who would love her, and in that period there was a deep dark loneliness that she had to face and befriend, and then we are pleased to report that she did fall in love, and in that period she was like chimes, or a flock of clean breaths, and her spine lying flat was the many-colored planks on the xylophone, but also she was rabid with fear of losing this love, because of past injury. And then what happened was that she became a wild-pregnant-mammal-thing and then she exploded herself by having a whole baby blast through her vagina during a global plague and then she was expected to carry on like everything was </p>

<p>Summary : Mere Christianity is C.S. Lewis&#8217;s forceful and accessible doctrine of Christian belief. First heard as informal radio broadcasts and then published as three separate books &#8211; The Case for Christianity, Christian Behavior, and Beyond Personality &#8211; Mere Christianity brings together what Lewis saw as the fundamental truths of the religion. Rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity&#8217;s many denominations, C.S. Lewis finds a common ground on which all those who have Christian faith can stand together, proving that &#8220;at the centre of each there is something, or a Someone, who against all divergences of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks the same voice.</p>

<p>Summary : Set on the coast of England against the vivid background of the sea, The Waves introduces six characters?three men and three women?who are grappling with the death of a beloved friend, Percival. Instead of describing their outward expressions of grief, Virginia Woolf draws her characters from the inside, revealing them through their thoughts and interior soliloquies. As their understanding of nature?s trials grows, the chorus of narrative voices blends together in miraculous harmony, remarking not only on the inevitable death of individuals but on the eternal connection of everyone. The novel that most epitomizes Virginia Woolf?s theories of fiction in the working form, The Waves is an amazing book very much ahead of its time. It is a poetic dreamscape, visual, experimental, and thrilling.</p>

<p>Summary : Elizabeth Blackwell believed from an early age that she was destined for a mission beyond the scope of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; womanhood. Though the world at first recoiled at the notion of a woman studying medicine, her intelligence and intensity ultimately won her the acceptance of the male medical establishment. In 1849, she became the first woman in America to receive an M.D. She was soon joined in her iconic achievement by her younger sister, Emily, who was actually the more brilliant physician.Exploring the sisters? allies, enemies, and enduring partnership, Janice P. Nimura presents a story of trial and triumph. Together, the Blackwells founded the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, the first hospital staffed entirely by women. Both sisters were tenacious and visionary, but their convictions did not always align with the emergence of women?s rights?or with each other.

<p>Summary : Elizabeth Blackwell believed from an early age that she was destined for a mission beyond the scope of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; womanhood. Though the world at first recoiled at the notion of a woman studying medicine, her intelligence and intensity ultimately won her the acceptance of the male medical establishment. In 1849, she became the first woman in America to receive an M.D. She was soon joined in her iconic achievement by her younger sister, Emily, who was actually the more brilliant physician.Exploring the sisters? allies, enemies, and enduring partnership, Janice P. Nimura presents a story of trial and triumph. Together, the Blackwells founded the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, the first hospital staffed entirely by women. Both sisters were tenacious and visionary, but their convictions did not always align with the emergence of women?s rights?or with each other.

<p>Summary : Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s long-time director and producer takes readers behind the scenes to reveal the insanity of filming television in some of the most far-flung and often volatile parts of the world, and what it was like to work with such a brilliant and complicated man.?In the nearly two years since Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s death, no one else has come close to filling the void he left. His passion for and genuine curiosity about the people and cultures he visited made the world feel smaller and more connected. Despite his affable, confident, and trademark snarky TV persona, the real Tony was intensely private, deeply conflicted about his fame, and an enigma even to those close to him. Tony?s devoted crew knew him best, and no one else had a front-row seat for as long as his director and producer, Tom Vitale.Over the course of more than a decade traveling together, Tony became a boss, a friend, a hero and, sometimes, a tormentor.In the Weeds takes readers behind the scenes to reveal not just </p>

<p>Summary : On Christmas Day, a University scrooge finds a murdered librarianEach December, the faculty of Balaclava Agricultural College goes wild with Christmas lights. The entire campus glitters with holiday decorations, save for one dark the home of professor Peter Shandy. But after years of resisting the Illumination festival, Shandy snaps, installing a million-watt display of flashing lights and blaring music perfectly calculated to drive his neighbors mad. The horticulturalist flees town, planning to spend Christmas on a tramp steamer, but soon feels guilty about his prank and returns home to find his Christmas lights extinguished, and a dead librarian in his living room.?Wishing to avoid a scandal, the school?s head asks Shandy to investigate the matter quietly. After all, Christmas is big business, and the town needs the cash infusion provided by the Illumination. As Peter Shandy will soon find, though, there is a dark side to even the whitest of white Christmases.</p>

<p>Summary : Bakersfield, Georgia, 1958: Thirteen-year-old Tangy Mae Quinn is the sixth of ten fatherless siblings. She is the darkest-skinned among them and therefore the ugliest in her mother, Rozelle&#8217;s, estimation, but she&#8217;s also the brightest. Rozelle&#8211;beautiful, charismatic, and light-skinned&#8211;exercises a violent hold over her children. Fearing abandonment, she pulls them from school at the age of twelve and sends them to earn their keep for the household, whether in domestic service, in the fields, or at &#8220;the farmhouse&#8221; on the edge of town, where Rozelle beds local men for money.But Tangy Mae has been selected to be part of the first integrated class at a nearby white high school.

<p>Summary : Bakersfield, Georgia, 1958: Thirteen-year-old Tangy Mae Quinn is the sixth of ten fatherless siblings. She is the darkest-skinned among them and therefore the ugliest in her mother, Rozelle&#8217;s, estimation, but she&#8217;s also the brightest. Rozelle&#8211;beautiful, charismatic, and light-skinned&#8211;exercises a violent hold over her children. Fearing abandonment, she pulls them from school at the age of twelve and sends them to earn their keep for the household, whether in domestic service, in the fields, or at &#8220;the farmhouse&#8221; on the edge of town, where Rozelle beds local men for money.But Tangy Mae has been selected to be part of the first integrated class at a nearby white high school. She has a chance to change her life, but can she break from Rozelle&#8217;s grasp without ruinous&#8211;even fatal&#8211;consequences?</p>

<p>Summary : There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men&#8217;s maximum-security:1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates.But none of the staff at the prison knows Brooke has already broken the rules. Nobody knows about her intimate connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary&#8217;s most notorious and dangerous inmates. And they certainly don&#8217;t know that Shane was Brooke&#8217;s high school sweetheart?the star quarterback who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for a series of grisly murders. Or that Brooke&#8217;s testimony was what put him there. But Shane knows. And he will never forget.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;La vita ? sogno&#8221;?? un dramma filosofico-teologico in tre atti e in versi scritto nel 1635 da Pedro Calder?n de La Barca (1600-1681). L&#8217;intera esistenza ? sogno, caratterizzata quindi da illusoriet?, fugacit? del tempo, vanit? delle cose terrene. L&#8217;unica realt? possibile ? la morte, che svela all&#8217;uomo la vera natura dell&#8217;esistenza, cio? l&#8217;illusoriet?, e quindi l&#8217;inconsistenza del mondo. Per queste idee l&#8217;opera teatrale ? emblematica del clima culturale dell&#8217;et? barocca ed ? un&#8217;opera fondamentale della letteratura barocca europea.?Pedro Calder?n de la Barca (Madrid, 17 gennaio 1600 ? Madrid, 25 maggio 1681) ? stato un drammaturgo e religioso spagnolo.? considerato l&#8217;ultima grande voce del Siglo de oro spagnolo.Traduzione di Giovanni La Cecilia</p>

<p>Summary :  He&#8217;d never wanted anyone enough to chase them&#8230;until he met her.

<p>Summary : Every parent wants their child to be happy and every parent wants to avoid screwing them up (the way their parents did!). But how do you do that?In this absorbing, clever, and warm book, renowned psychotherapist Philippa Perry tells us what really matters and what behavior it is important to avoid&#8211;the vital dos and don&#8217;ts of parenting.Her approach begins with parents themselves and their own psychological make-up and history&#8211;and how that in turn influences one&#8217;s parenting.Instead of mapping out the &#8220;perfect&#8221; plan, Perry offers a big-picture look at the elements that lead to good parent-child relationships. This refreshing judgement-free book will help you to:  &#8211; Understand how your own upbringing may affect your parenting &#8211; Accept that you will make mistakes and learn what you can do about them &#8211; Break negative cycles and patterns &#8211; Handle your own and child&#8217;s feelings &#8211; Understand what different behaviors communicateFull of sage and sane advice, The Book You Wish Your Parents Had </p>

<p>Summary : Every parent wants their child to be happy and every parent wants to avoid screwing them up (the way their parents did!). But how do you do that?In this absorbing, clever, and warm book, renowned psychotherapist Philippa Perry tells us what really matters and what behavior it is important to avoid&#8211;the vital dos and don&#8217;ts of parenting.Her approach begins with parents themselves and their own psychological make-up and history&#8211;and how that in turn influences one&#8217;s parenting.Instead of mapping out the &#8220;perfect&#8221; plan, Perry offers a big-picture look at the elements that lead to good parent-child relationships. This refreshing judgement-free book will help you to:  &#8211; Understand how your own upbringing may affect your parenting &#8211; Accept that you will make mistakes and learn what you can do about them &#8211; Break negative cycles and patterns &#8211; Handle your own and child&#8217;s feelings &#8211; Understand what different behaviors communicateFull of sage and sane advice, The Book You Wish Your Parents Had </p>

<p>Summary : Do you have talents and capabilities that you may not be using to their greatest potential? Do you have dreams you wish to realize? All great accomplishments start with a dream, an idea in the mind of the achiever. In this book, Dr. Murphy shows you how you can make those dreams come true. It starts with developing the right mental attitude?the conviction that you have what it takes. This faith in yourself will enable you to program your subconscious mind to convert your dreams and hopes into achievements. God has given you talents. By developing and using them, you stimulate your conscious mind, which is the motor that energizes the subconscious mind?the engine that will do the work. Within these pages, you will read how poets, artists, inventors, and entrepreneurs implemented their dreams and ideas to become rewarding and profitable accomplishments, and how you can apply the same techniques to enrich your life.</p>

<p>Summary : Franklin Foer tells the definitive insider story of the first two years of the Biden presidency, with exclusive access to Biden?s longtime team of advisers, and presents a gripping portrait of a president during this momentous time in our nation?s history.On January 20, 2021, standing where only two weeks earlier police officers had battled with right-wing paramilitaries, Joe Biden took his oath of office. The American people were still sick with COVID-19, his economists were already warning him of an imminent financial crisis, and his party, the Democrats, had the barest of majorities in the Senate. Yet, faced with an unprecedented set of crises, Joe Biden decided he would not play defense. Instead, he set out to transform the nation. He proposed the most ambitious domestic spending bills since the 1960s and vowed to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan, ending the nation?s longest war and reorienting it toward a looming competition with China.With unparalleled access to the </p>

<p>Summary : Isaac Fitzgerald has lived many lives. He&#8217;s been an altar boy, a bartender, a fat kid, a smuggler, a biker, a prince of New England. But before all that, he was a bomb that exploded his parents&#8217; lives-or so he was told. In Dirtbag, Massachusetts, Fitzgerald, with warmth and humor, recounts his ongoing search for forgiveness, a more far-reaching vision of masculinity, and a more expansive definition of family and self.Fitzgerald&#8217;s memoir-in-essays begins with a childhood that moves at breakneck speed from safety to violence, recounting an extraordinary pilgrimage through trauma to self-understanding and, ultimately, acceptance. From growing up in a Boston homeless shelter to bartending in San Francisco, from smuggling medical supplies into Burma to his lifelong struggle to make peace with his body, Fitzgerald strives to take control of his own story: one that aims to put aside anger, isolation, and entitlement to embrace the idea that one can be generous to oneself by being generous </p>

<p>Summary : Rhys Koteskiy is back ? at least, he&#8217;s supposed to be.During last year?s Frozen Four, the Waterfell University hockey captain, and NHL legacy, took a brutal hit that left him with a concussion and a new discomfort on the ice.

<p>Summary : The Metaphysics of Morals is Kant&#8217;s final major work in moral philosophy. In it, he presents the basic concepts and principles of right and virtue and the system of duties of human beings as such. The work comprises two parts: the Doctrine of Right concerns outer freedom and the rights of human beings against one another; the Doctrine of Virtue concerns inner freedom and the ethical duties of human beings to themselves and others. Mary Gregor&#8217;s translation, lightly revised for this edition, is the only complete translation of the entire text, and includes extensive annotation on Kant&#8217;s difficult and sometimes unfamiliar vocabulary. This edition includes numerous new footnotes, some of which address controversial aspects of Gregor&#8217;s translation or offer alternatives. Lara Denis&#8217;s introduction sets the work in context, explains its structure and themes, and introduces important interpretive debates. The volume also provides thorough guidance on further reading including online resources.</p>

<p>Summary : A beautiful unabridged 150th Anniversary Edition with 200 original illustrations and a Foreword by Alice L. George entitled &#8220;Why Little Women Endures 150 Years Later.&#8221;Little Women was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. This edition contains both volumes. It follows the lives of the four March sisters&#8211;Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy&#8211; from childhood to womanhood and is loosely based on the author and her three sisters. Although Little Women was a novel for girls, it differed notably from the current writings for children, especially girls. The book was an immediate commercial and critical success and has since been adapted for cinema, TV, Broadway and even the opera.</p>

<p>Summary : Every year, the people of the Protectorate leave a baby as an offering to the witch who lives in the forest. They hope this sacrifice will keep her from terrorizing their town. But the witch in the forest, Xan, is kind and gentle. She shares her home with a wise Swamp Monster named Glerk and a Perfectly Tiny Dragon, Fyrian. Xan rescues the abandoned children and deliver them to welcoming families on the other side of the forest, nourishing the babies with starlight on the journey.? One year, Xan accidentally feeds a baby moonlight instead of starlight, filling the ordinary child with extraordinary magic. Xan decides she must raise this enmagicked girl, whom she calls Luna, as her own. To keep young Luna safe from her own unwieldy power, Xan locks her magic deep inside her. When Luna approaches her thirteenth birthday, her magic begins to emerge on schedule&#8211;but Xan is far away. Meanwhile, a?young man from the Protectorate is determined to free his people by killing the witch. Soon, </p>
