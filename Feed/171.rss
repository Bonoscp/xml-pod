As a frequent guest columnist for the New York Times, Patti Davis has distinguished herself as one of our wisest contemporary storytellers. Far from being the enfant terrible she was once portrayed to be, Davis here turns an honest yet empathetic eye toward her parents, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, combining bittersweet recollections?of her father, the eternal lifeguard, who saved 77 people from drowning yet failed to create a coherent AIDS policy, and of her mother, who never escaped the torture chamber of her own youth?with comedic scenes as if plucked from a sitcom, as she describes marrying her yoga instructor at the Hotel Bel-Air, hiding her marijuana stash from the FBI, and constantly evading the Secret Service. An inherently wise work about a family finally reunited through Ronald Reagan?s Alzheimer?s diagnosis, Dear </p>

This singular event will shape not only the rest of her life but also the future of mankind.Four decades later, Beijing police ask nanotech engineer Wang Miao to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientists after a spate of inexplicable suicides. Wang&#8217;s investigation will lead him to a mysterious online game and immerse him in a virtual world ruled by the intractable and unpredictable interaction of its three suns.This is the Three-Body Problem and it is the key to everything: the key to the scientists&#8217; deaths, the key to a conspiracy that spans light-years and the key to the extinction-level threat humanity now faces.</p>

As you read this you are currently orbiting a black hole. Money might make the world go round, but black holes make the universe go round.Black holes are not just a curiosity; they are some of the most important objects for understanding how our universe works and how it came to be. And yet they are incredibly misunderstood; take everything you think you know about black holes and get rid of it.This book will be a book about black holes like no other; it will journey beyond the event horizon and consider what the ?inside? of a black hole is truly like, and flip it on its head. It will take black holes and turn them from something beyond comprehension for the average person on the street to a level of understanding you never thought possible, through unique analogies and ideas the human brain has a hope of actually picturing. This book will show you why </p>

<p>Summary : La montagna non ? solo neve e dirupi, creste, torrenti, laghi, pascoli. La montagna ? un modo di vivere la vita. Un passo davanti all&#8217;altro, silenzio, tempo e misura. Lo ha imparato Paolo Cognetti, che tra una vetta e una baita ambienta questo potentissimo romanzo. Una storia di amicizia tra due ragazzi &#8211; e poi due uomini &#8211; cos? diversi da assomigliarsi, un viaggio avventuroso e spirituale fatto di fughe e tentativi di ritorno, alla continua ricerca di una strada per riconoscersi.</p>

<p>Summary : L&#8217;Orient Express, il leggendario treno delle spie e degli avventurieri internazionali, occupa un posto importante nell&#8217;immaginario degli appassionati di letteratura. Il merito ? di questo libro. In quella che probabilmente ? la pi? celebre delle sue imprese, Hercule Poirot, salito a bordo di un vagone di prima classe partito da Istanbul e diretto a Calais, ? costretto a occuparsi di un efferato delitto: mentre il treno ? bloccato dalla neve sui Balcani, qualcuno tra i passeggeri pugnala a morte il signor Ratchett, un ricco quanto insopportabile cittadino americano. L&#8217;assassino deve per forza nascondersi tra i viaggiatori, ma nessuno di loro sembra avere un movente. Almeno in apparenza&#8230; Pubblicato nel 1934, &#8220;Assassinio sull&#8217;Orient Express&#8221; ? da molti considerato il capolavoro di Agatha Christie, ed ? sicuramente uno dei gialli pi? noti e letti in tutto il mondo.</p>

<p>Summary : For readers of Modern Lovers and Conversations with Friends, an addictive, humorous, and poignant debut novel about the shock waves caused by one couple&#8217;s impulsive marriage.Twenty-four-year-old British painter Cleo has escaped from England to New York and is still finding her place in the sleepless city when, a few months before her student visa ends, she meets Frank. Twenty years older and a self-made success, Frank&#8217;s life is full of all the excesses Cleo&#8217;s lacks. He offers her the chance to be happy, the freedom to paint, and the opportunity to apply for a Green Card. But their impulsive marriage irreversibly changes both their lives, and the lives of those close to them, in ways they never could&#8217;ve predicted.Each compulsively readable chapter explores the lives of Cleo, Frank, and an unforgettable cast of their closest friends and family as they grow up and grow older. Whether it&#8217;s Cleo&#8217;s best friend struggling to embrace his gender queerness in the wake of Cleo&#8217;s marriage, or </p>

<p>Summary : The fifth novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the best of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path that can only end in fire.The galaxy is burning. With the Cielcin united under one banner, the Sollan Empire stands alone after the betrayal of the Commonwealth. The Prophet-King of the Cielcin has sent its armies to burn the worlds of men, and worse, there are rumors&#8230;whispers that Hadrian Marlowe is dead, killed in the fighting. But it is not so. Hadrian survived with the help of the witch, Valka, and together they escaped the net of the enemy having learned a terrible truth: the gods that the Cielcin worship are real and will not rest until the universe is dark and cold. What is more, the Emperor himself is in danger. The Prophet-King has learned to track his movements as he travels along the borders of Imperial space. Now the Cielcin legions are closing in, their swords poised to strike off the head of all mankind.</p>

Na Gr?cia antiga e em Roma, o animal era o consorte de Artemis, a ca?adora, e carinhosamente amamentava os her?is.

<p>Summary : Eve Duncan and Riley Smith must solve their most exciting puzzle since A Face to Die For when asked to uncover the mysterious secret hidden on a remote island. When archeologist Riley Smith comes to ask Eve Duncan for help, Eve has to say no. Traveling halfway around the world on a dangerous quest is not her expertise as a forensic sculptor. But Eve is intrigued by the prospect of an isolated island that holds a secret locked in time.  Traveling to Southeast Asia, Riley is aware of the threat from treasure hunters who are already searching and have no qualms about killing to get what they want. When she successfully evades them and finds the perfectly preserved body of a female warrior, it is just what she needs to entice Eve to help unlock the mystery.  As these two strong women seek answers about this extraordinary past life, Riley makes a living, breathing discovery that will change history. If she can escape the island and survive long enough to share it with the world.</p>

He can?t stop thinking about her and holding his breath every time they cross paths. It feels like she?s becoming a part of him. Except he knows they?re not free to give in to this.

<p>Summary : Jordan has nowhere else to go when her boyfriend offers to let her move in with him and his dad. Working a dead-end job, with her relationship sputtering, she jumps at the opportunity, expecting to help out around the house in exchange. ?What she doesn?t anticipate is for her heart to race every time Pike pulls into the driveway, or to burn when their eyes meet over the breakfast table. He?s kind and listens to her and protects her in a way no man ever has before. Her sister once told her there are no good men, and if you find one, he&#8217;s probably unavailable. Only Pike isn&#8217;t the unavailable one?she is.As the days go by, Pike?s finding it anything but simple to have his son?s girlfriend living in his house. He can?t stop thinking about her and holding his breath every time they cross paths. It feels like she?s becoming a part of him. Except he knows they?re not free to give in to this. How could they when he?s her boyfriend?s father?</p>

<p>Summary : In this beautifully illustrated and deeply philosophical graphic memoir, legendary artist Ai Weiwei explores the connection between artistic expression and intellectual freedom through?interwoven stories from all the seasons of his life. As a child living in exile during the Cultural Revolution, Ai Weiwei often found himself with nothing to read but government-approved comic books. Although they were restricted by the confines of political propaganda, Ai Weiwei was struck by the artists&#8217; ability to express their thoughts on art and humanity through graphic storytelling. Now, decades later, Ai Weiwei and Italian comic artist Gianluca Costantini present Zodiac, Ai Weiwei&#8217;s first graphic memoir. Inspired by the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac and their associated human characteristics, Ai Weiwei masterfully interweaves ancient Chinese folklore with stories of his life, family, and career. The narrative shifts back and forth through the years?at once in the past, present, and </p>

<p>Summary : WINNER OF THE 2022 PULITZER PRIZE&#8221;A compelling and important history that this nation desperately needs to hear.&#8221; -Bryan Stevenson, New York Times bestselling author of Just Mercy and executive director of the Equal Justice InitiativeChasing Me to My Grave presents the late artist Winfred Rembert&#8217;s breathtaking body of work alongside his story, as told to Tufts Philosopher Erin I. Kelly. Rembert grew up in a family of Georgia field laborers, joined the Civil Rights Movement as a teenager, survived a near-lynching at the hands of law enforcement, and spent seven years on chain gangs.

<p>Summary : A moving, heartbreaking, and lyrical true story of the author&#8217;s escape from an apocalyptic cult&#8211;and the survival skills that led to her freedom.As a child, Michelle Dowd grew up on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest. She was born into an ultra-religious cult&#8211;or the Field as they called it&#8211;started in the 1930s by her grandfather, a mercurial, domineering, and charismatic man who convinced generations of young male followers that he would live 500 years and ascend to the heavens when doomsday came. Comfort and care are sins, Michelle is told. As a result, she was forced to learn the skills necessary to battle hunger, thirst, and cold; she learned to trust animals more than humans; and most importantly, she learned how to survive in the natural world. At the Field, a young Michelle lives a life of abuse, poverty, and isolation, as she obeys her family&#8217;s rigorous religious and patriarchal rules&#8211;which are so extreme that Michelle is convinced her mother would sacrifice her, </p>

<p>Summary : Familie Rath steuert auf ein dramatisches Ende zu: Gereon hat nach der R?ckkehr aus den USA ein Versteck in Rh?ndorf bei Bonn bezogen und schl?gt sich nach Berlin durch, um Charly beizustehen. Sie muss Hannah Singer aus den Wittenauer Heilst?tten befreien und Fritze verteidigen, der unter Mordverdacht ger?t. Der Judenhass w?chst und mit der Reichsprgromnacht kulminiert eine Entwicklung, die Charly vorhergesehen und Gereon lange geleugnet hat. Damit ist beiden klar: Ein Leben in Deutschland ist so nicht mehr m?glich, Widerstand ist geboten. Haben sie eine gemeinsame Zukunft und wo w?rde die liegen? Mit gewohnt hoher Spannung, historischer Tiefensch?rfe und psychologischer Figurenzeichnung bringt Volker Kutscher seine Erfolgsserie zu einem offenen Abschluss.</p>

<p>Summary : Show Up and Let Yourself be Seen Is vulnerability the same as weakness? ?In our culture,? teaches Dr. Bren? Brown, ?we associate vulnerability with emotions we want to avoid such as fear, shame, and uncertainty. Yet we too often lose sight of the fact that vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, belonging, creativity, authenticity, and love.? On The Power of Vulnerability, Dr. Brown offers an invitation and a promise &#8211; that when we dare to drop the armor that protects us from feeling vulnerable, we open ourselves to the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Here she dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and reveals that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.?The Power of Vulnerability is a very personal project for me,? Bren? explains. ?This is the first place that all of my work comes together. This audio course draws from all three of my books &#8211; it?s the culmination of everything I?ve learned over the past twelve years. I&#8217;m </p>

<p>Summary : One of Literary Hub&#8217;s most anticipated books of 2021Award-winning master critic Robert Gottlieb takes a singular and multifaceted look at the life of silver screen legend Greta Garbo, and the culture that worshiped her.?Wherever you look in the period between 1925 and 1941,? Robert Gottlieb writes in Garbo, ?Greta Garbo is in people?s minds, hearts, and dreams.? Strikingly glamorous and famously inscrutable, she managed, in sixteen short years, to infiltrate the world?s subconscious; the end of her film career, when she was thirty-six, only made her more irresistible. Garbo appeared in just twenty-four Hollywood movies, yet her impact on the world?and that indescribable, transcendent presence she possessed?was rivaled only by Marilyn Monroe?s. She was looked on as a unique phenomenon, a sphinx, a myth, the most beautiful woman in the world, but in reality she was a Swedish peasant girl, uneducated, na?ve, and always on her guard. When she arrived in Hollywood, aged nineteen, she </p>

<p>Summary : Laugh-out-loud, deeply insightful, and emotion-filled essays from multi-talented actress, comedian, podcaster, and writer Casey Wilson. Casey Wilson has a lot on her mind and she isn&#8217;t afraid to share. In this dazzling collection of essays, skillfully constructed and brimming with emotion, she shares her thoughts on the joys and vagaries of modern-day womanhood and motherhood, introduces the not-quite-typical family that made her who she is, and persuasively argues that lowbrow pop culture is the perfect lens through which to understand human nature.Whether she&#8217;s extolling the virtues of eating in bed, processing the humiliation over her father&#8217;s late in life perm, or exploring her pathological need to be liked, Casey is witty, candid, and full of poignant and funny surprises. Humorous dives into her obsessions and areas of personal expertise&#8211;Scientology and self-help, nice guys, reality television shows&#8211;are matched by touching meditations on female friendship, grief, motherhood, </p>

<p>Summary : The memoir of a refugee caught between her identity as a gay woman and the love and life debt she owes her mother. When Putsata Reang was 11 months old, her family fled war-torn Cambodia, spending 23 days on an overcrowded navy vessel before finding sanctuary at an American naval base in the Philippines. Holding what appeared to be a lifeless baby in her arms, Ma resisted the captain&#8217;s orders to throw her bundle overboard. Instead, on landing, Ma rushed her baby into the arms of American military nurses and doctors, who saved the child&#8217;s life. &#8220;I had hope, just a little, you were still alive,&#8221; Ma would tell Put in an oft-repeated story that became family legend.Over the years, Put lived to please Ma and make her proud, hustling to repay her life debt by becoming the consummate good Cambodian daughter, working steadfastly by Ma&#8217;s side in the berry fields each summer and eventually building a successful career as an award-winning journalist. But Put&#8217;s adoration and efforts are no match </p>

<p>Summary : L&#8217;apocalypse a eu lieu. Le monde est d?vast?, couvert de cendres et de cadavres. Parmi les survivants, un p?re et son fils errent sur une route, poussant un caddie rempli d&#8217;objets h?t?roclites, cens?s les aider dans leur voyage.

Publicado em 1848, na contracorrente de sua ?poca, que privilegiava o Realismo, este livro ?, na obra de Dostoi?vski, aquele que mais se aproxima da escola rom?ntica. N?o apenas pelo tipo do Sonhador, figura central da novela, mas tamb?m pela atmosfera delicada e fantasmag?rica, que envolve a trama, o cen?rio e os protagonistas. Aqui, a pr?pria cidade de S?o Petersburgo &#8211; com seus pal?cios e pontes, seus espa?os monumentais &#8211; revela-se como personagem.

<p>Summary : Durante uma das singulares &#8220;noites brancas&#8221; do ver?o de S?o Petersburgo, em que o sol praticamente n?o se p?e, dois jovens se encontram numa ponte sobre o rio Niev? e d?o in?cio a uma hist?ria repleta de fantasia e lirismo. Publicado em 1848, na contracorrente de sua ?poca, que privilegiava o Realismo, este livro ?, na obra de Dostoi?vski, aquele que mais se aproxima da escola rom?ntica. N?o apenas pelo tipo do Sonhador, figura central da novela, mas tamb?m pela atmosfera delicada e fantasmag?rica, que envolve a trama, o cen?rio e os protagonistas. Aqui, a pr?pria cidade de S?o Petersburgo &#8211; com seus pal?cios e pontes, seus espa?os monumentais &#8211; revela-se como personagem.

<p>Summary : It was supposed to be one night. Now he&#8217;s obsessed. When my one-night-stand turns into an all-time-fail, I vow not to tell anyone about the much older hottie who walked out on me mid-deed. (On my twenty-first birthday, no less.) Too bad I bump into my almost lover at my mother?s wedding a few months later. That&#8217;s when I discover he?s none other than Reid Sebastian?my new step cousin and the billionaire son of my step-dad?s rival. Which means he?s my rival, too, obviously. While I thought he was cruel before, he&#8217;s become obsessed with torturing me. And because we&#8217;re family, he&#8217;s always around. Now we&#8217;re playing a brutal game that neither of us can possibly win. But I have a secret?the more we play the more I want him. Even if it means we both lose everything. Brutal Secret is a complete standalone forbidden, age-gap, forced proximity romance set in an intriguing world of billionaires, power, and scandal. While it is recommended to read Brutal Billionaire first for best reading </p>

<p>Summary : A searing, deeply moving memoir of illness and recovery that traces one young woman?s journey from diagnosis to remission and, ultimately, a road trip of healing and self-discovery.In the summer after graduating from college, Suleika Jaouad was preparing, as they say in commencement speeches, to enter ?the real world.? She had fallen in love and moved to Paris to pursue her dream of becoming a war correspondent. The real world she found, however, would take her into a very different kind of conflict zone.It started with an itch?first on her feet, then up her legs, like a thousand invisible mosquito bites. Next came the exhaustion, and the six-hour naps that only deepened her fatigue. Then a trip to the doctor and, a few weeks shy of her twenty-third birthday, a diagnosis: leukemia, with a 35 percent chance of survival.

<p>Summary : &#8216;The most perfect specimen of the dramatic art existing in the world&#8217; Percy Bysshe ShelleyShakespeare&#8217;s bleak and brutal tragedy begins when an ageing king, seeking a successor, rejects the young daughter who loves him and misplaces his trust in her malevolent sisters. In return they strip him of his power and condemn him to a wretched wasteland of horror and insanity. Set in a pitiless universe, King Lear is a towering, elemental masterpiece of fierce poetry and vast imaginative scope.Used and Recommended by the National TheatreGeneral Editor Stanley WellsEdited by George HunterIntroduction by Kiernan Ryan</p>

<p>Summary : A solitary woman?s inspiring, moving, surprising, and often funny memoir about the transformative power of her unusual friendship with a wild fox, a new window onto the natural world, and the introduction of a remarkable literary talent.Catherine Raven left home at 15, fleeing an abusive father and an indifferent mother. Drawn to the natural world, for years she worked as a ranger in National Parks, at times living in her run-down car (which lacked a reverse gear), on abandoned construction sites, or camping on a piece of land in Montana she bought from a colleague. She managed to put herself through college and then graduate school, eventually earning a Ph.D. in biology.Yet she never felt at home with people, and though she worked at various universities and taught field classes in the National Parks, she built a house on a remote plot of land in Montana and, except when teaching, spoke to no one.

<p>Summary : Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl&#8217;s memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.</p>

<p>Summary : Big, brainy science for the littlest listeners.Accurate enough to satisfy an expert, yet simple enough for baby, this clever board book showcases the use of logic, sequence, and patterns to solve problems. Can Baby think like a coder to fix her train? Beautiful, visually stimulating illustrations complement age-appropriate language to encourage baby&#8217;s sense of wonder. Parents and caregivers may learn a thing or two, as well!Author&#8217;s Note: The goal of the Baby Loves Science books is to introduce STEM topics in a developmentally appropriate way. As a precursor to learning programming languages and syntax, Baby Loves Coding presents the concepts of sequencing, problem solving, cause and effect, and thinking step-by-step. Practicing these skills early creates a solid foundation for reading, writing, math and eventually, programming.</p>

<p>Summary : Why do we do the things we do? More than a decade in the making, this game-changing book is Robert Sapolsky&#8217;s genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. Sapolsky&#8217;s storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person&#8217;s reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy. And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs&#8211;whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person&#8217;s brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours </p>

<p>Summary : Why are the cocky ones always the hardest to resist?Because this man . . . this man is temptation personified. He?s six feet, four inches of rock-solid, golden muscles that are inked to perfection and proudly displayed every time he steps into the cage. And I?m the idiot who agreed to stay with him for the next few days.Hudson ?The King? Kingston knew he had a fight coming up when he risked himself to save me. How could I say no when he needed a friend to help him out? Because that?s exactly what we?ve always been?friends.Friends who flirt.Friends who tease.Friends who never cross that line.Ever.The problem is the more time we spend together, the more things shift between us. But no matter how much I wish he could be my first, he?s never been a relationship guy, and I refuse to settle for anything less.I know I can trust him with my life, but can I trust him with my heart?</p>

<p>Summary : From the author of the much-praised The Last Mona Lisa comes another thrilling story of masterpieces, masterminds, and mystery.?For years, there have been whispers that, before his death, Van Gogh completed a final self-portrait. Curators and art historians have savored this rumor, hoping it could illuminate some of the troubled artist&#8217;s many secrets, but even they have to concede that the missing painting is likely lost forever.But when Luke Perrone, artist and great-grandson of the man who stole the Mona Lisa, and Alexis Verde, daughter of a notorious art thief, discover what may be the missing portrait, they are drawn into a most epic art puzzles. When only days later the painting disappears again, they are reunited with INTERPOL agent John Washington Smith in a dangerous and deadly search that will not only expose secrets of the artist&#8217;s last days but draws them into one of history&#8217;s darkest eras.Beneath the paint and canvas, beneath the beauty and the legend, the artwork has </p>

<p>Summary : A powerful, candid, and richly detailed memoir from an American icon, revealing what life looks like after presidency: triumphs, tribulations, and all.On January 20th, 2001, after nearly thirty years in politics?eight of them as President of the United States?Bill Clinton was suddenly a private citizen.

Just days after leaving the White House, the call came to aid victims of a devastating earthquake in India, and Clinton hit the ground running. Over the next two decades, he would create an enduring legacy of public service and advocacy work, from Indonesia to Louisiana, Northern Ireland to South Africa, and in the process reimagine philanthropy and redefine the impact a former president could have on the world.Citizen is Clinton?s front-row, first-person chronicle of his post-presidential </p>

<p>Summary : A deeply honest investigation of what it means to be a woman and a commodity. Emily Ratajkowski is an acclaimed model and actress, an engaged political progressive, a formidable entrepreneur, a global social media phenomenon, and now, a writer. Rocketing to world fame at age twenty-one, Ratajkowski sparked both praise and furor with the provocative display of her body as an unapologetic statement of feminist empowerment. The subsequent evolution in her thinking about our culture?s commodification of women is the subject of this book. My Body is a profoundly personal exploration of feminism, sexuality, and power, of men&#8217;s treatment of women and women&#8217;s rationalizations for accepting that treatment. These essays chronicle moments from Ratajkowski?s life while investigating the culture?s fetishization of girls and female beauty, its obsession with and contempt for women?s sexuality, the perverse dynamics of the fashion and film industries, and the gray area between consent and abuse. </p>
