<p>Summary : How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end.The Carryx?part empire, part hive?have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin.Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team. Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them.They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;Enormously pleasurable, deeply moving. A bid to save our rich hoard of landscape language, and a blow struck for the power of a deep creative relationship to place&#8217; Financial TimesLandmarks is Robert Macfarlane&#8217;s joyous meditation on words, landscape and the relationship between the two.Words are grained into our landscapes, and landscapes are grained into our words. Landmarks is about the power of language to shape our sense of place. It is a field guide to the literature of nature, and a glossary containing thousands of remarkable words used in England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales to describe land, nature and weather.Travelling from Cumbria to the Cairngorms, and exploring the landscapes of Roger Deakin, J. A. Baker, Nan Shepherd and others, Robert Macfarlane shows that language, well used, is a keen way of knowing landscape, and a vital means of coming to love it.&#8217;Thoughtful and lyrical writing . . . It&#8217;s gorgeous&#8217; Independent on Sunday&#8217;His writing has a confidence and enjoyment, </p>

<p>Summary : A positive vision for masculinity in a postfeminist worldBoys and men are struggling. Profound economic and social changes of recent decades have many losing ground in the classroom, the workplace, and in the family.

Conservative and progressive politicians, mired in their own ideological warfare, fail to provide thoughtful solutions.The father of three sons, a journalist, and a Brookings Institution scholar, Richard V. Reeves has spent twenty-five years worrying about boys both at home and work. His new book, Of Boys and Men, tackles the complex and urgent crisis of boyhood and manhood.Reeves looks at the structural challenges that face boys and men and offers fresh and innovative solutions that turn the page on the corrosive narrative that plagues this issue.

<p>Summary : An exhilarating spy thriller about two women CIA agents who become intertwined around a threat to the Russia Division&#8211;one that&#8217;s coming from inside the agency.Lyndsey Duncan worries her career with the CIA might be over. After lines are crossed with another intelligence agent during her most recent assignment, she is sent home to Washington on administrative leave. So when a former colleague, now Chief of the Russia Division, recruits her for an internal investigation, she jumps at the chance to prove herself once more. Lyndsey was once a top handler in the Moscow Field Station, known as the &#8220;human lie detector&#8221; and praised for recruiting some of the most senior Russian officials. But now, three Russian assets have been discovered&#8211;including one of her own&#8211;and the CIA is convinced there&#8217;s a mole in the department. With years of work in question, and lives on the line, Lyndsey is thrown back into life at the agency, only this time tracing the steps of those closest to her.Meanwhile, </p>

<p>Summary : La selva es un dios hambriento. Uno que permite vivir a salvo en sus dominios pero exige el m?s alto de los precios a cambio. Su voracidad no termina nunca y aquellos que viven bajo su control deben entregarle a sus hijos como parte de un c?clico tributo can?bal.En este cuento de terror caribe?o, las madres son obligadas a criar a sus propios hijos como futuro alimento, en un sacrificio hecho de sangre y locura. Si se desea sobrevivir aqu?, ninguna mujer puede decidir no ser madre. Y ninguna madre puede no convertirse en una mera productora de carne humana para que el sistema de ofrendas y retribuciones siga funcionando.En un mundo despiadado de guerrilleros y narcos, la selva garantiza la seguridad a sus habitantes, quienes renuncian a cualquier tipo de derecho y esperanza en esta f?bula terrible sobre la maternidad y el cuerpo de la mujer.</p>

<p>Summary : Samantha Irby?s career has taken her to new heights. She dodges calls from Hollywood and flop sweats on the red carpet at premieres (well, one premiere). But nothing is ever as it seems online, where she can crop out all the ugly parts.Irby got a lot of weird emails about Carrie Bradshaw, and not only is there diarrhea to avoid, but now?anaphylactic shock. She is turned away from restaurants for being inappropriately dressed and looks for the best ways to cope, i.e., reveling in the offerings of QVC and adopting a deranged pandemic dog. Quietly Hostile makes light as Irby takes us on another outrageously funny tour of all the gory details that make up the true portrait of a life behind the screenshotted depression memes. Relatable, poignant, and uproarious, once again, Irby is the tonic we all need to get by.</p>

<p>Summary : Une jeune femme dans une situation tragique ?crit ? l?homme qu?elle a aim? passionn?ment, depuis l?enfance, pour lui rappeler son histoire : de leurs trois nuits d?amour est n? un enfant qu?elle a ?lev? seule. Elle cherche ? renouer le fil de leur relation. Mais son ancien amant est un brillant s?ducteur, un ?crivain qui jouit ?go?stement des plaisirs de la vie. Pour lui, elle n?est qu?une femme parmi d?autres ; pour elle, il est tout. Peut-il se souvenir d?elle ? Dans cette poignante nouvelle, publi?e en 1922, Zweig analyse les psychologies f?minine et masculine avec une acuit? rare. Entre amour et oubli, plaisir physique et profondeur spirituelle, cette histoire d?obsession amoureuse, cruelle et crue, est d?une stup?fiante modernit?.</p>

<p>Summary : From one of the most powerful and authentic voices in Southern fiction comes a historical novel with an unforgettable heroine?the extraordinary Joetta McBride, who defiantly opens her North Carolina home and farm to soldiers from both sides during the Civil War.Talk of impending war is a steady drumbeat throughout North Carolina, though Joetta McBride pays it little heed. The small farm she tends with her husband, Ennis, and their two sons provides all they need. Those who want to fight can fight, but Joetta considers her family to be neutral.That opinion isn?t shared by Joetta?s father-in-law, Rudean. A staunch Confederate supporter, he fills his grandsons? heads with stories about the glories of soldiering, and insists that owning land and slaves is the only measure of success. When fifteen-year-old Henry, impressed by his grandfather?s stories, runs off to volunteer, Joetta insists Ennis go and search for him.Weeks pass without word from either father or son, though other soldiers </p>

<p>Summary : Zez? vuole fare il poeta e vestirsi elegante. Ma al momento ? solo un bambino brasiliano di cinque anni che abita in una favela. A scuola, grazie alla sua immaginazione esuberante, ? il pupillo della maestra; a casa, invece, il suo amore per gli scherzi gli procura solo rimproveri e legnate da parte dei genitori. Non ? facile per un bambino intelligente e sensibile come lui crescere in una famiglia povera. Per fortuna Zez? ha due amici: il Portoghese, proprietario dell&#8217;auto pi? cool del quartiere; e una pianticella di arance che, un giorno, decide di parlare con lui. Pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1968, Il mio albero di arance dolci ? l&#8217;emozionante storia di un bambino costretto dalle circostanze della vita a diventare adulto prima del tempo. In questo romanzo Jos? Mauro de Vasconcelos ha ricreato i suoi ricordi d&#8217;infanzia a Rio de Janeiro, mescolando realismo, poesia, denuncia sociale e una tenerezza che continua a incantare generazioni di lettori in tutto il mondo.</p>

<p>Summary : Neuromancer/Count Zero/Mona Lisa OverdriveCase var den smartaste datatjuven av alla, innan han hamnade i on?d och fick nervsystemet utslaget. Men en ny uppdragsgivare ger honom en sista chans, och han ger sig ut efter en o?vertr?ffad artificiell intelligens. William Gibsons Neuromancer [1984] f?reb?dade inte bara world wide web utan blev ocks? upphovet till en helt ny genre: cyberpunk. Redan tv? ?r tidigare hade Gibson myntat begreppet cyberspace, och nu blev han i ett slag en av v?rldens mest omtalade och inflytelserika f?rfattare. Debutromanen f?ljdes snart av Count Zero och Mona Lisa Overdrive, vilka bildar den epokg?rande Neuromancer-trilogin (?ven k?nd som Sprawl-trilogin), ett verk som likt f? andra har utmanat grundl?ggande f?rest?llningar om teknologi och m?nsklighet. ?nnu f?rre har haft en s?dan djupg?ende inverkan p? den moderna m?nsklighetens sj?lvbild. Och inget av dem har skrivits i ett lika ursinnigt tempo eller med s?dan hallucinatorisk klarsyn. I svensk ?vers?ttning </p>

Drug deals dominate street corners, and ruthless, casual violence abounds.Montana Barronette grew up in the center of it all. He was the leader of the gang ?Trained to Go,? or TTG, and when he was finally arrested and sentenced to life in prison, he had been nicknamed ?Baltimore?s Number One Trigger Puller.? Under Tana?s reign, TTG dominated Sandtown. After a string of murders are linked to TTG, each with dozens of witnesses too intimidated to testify, three detectives set out to put Tana in prison for life.

<p>Summary : Spy satellites orbiting the Moon. Space metals worth billions. Humans on Mars within our lifetimes. This isn?t science fiction. It?s astropolitics. We?re entering a new space race ? and it could revolutionise life on Earth. the new frontier, a wild and lawless place. It is already central to communication, economics, military strategy and international relations on Earth. Now, it is the latest arena for human exploration, exploitation ? and, possibly, conquest. We?re heading up and out, and we?re taking our power struggles with us. China, the USA and Russia are leading the way.From physical territory and resources to satellites, weaponry and strategic choke points, geopolitics is as important in the skies above us as it is down below. If you?ve ever wondered if humans are going back to the Moon, who will benefit from exploration or what space wars might look like, the answers are here.With all the insight and wit that have made Tim Marshall the UK?s most popular writer on </p>

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.</p>
<p>    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.</p>
<p>People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.He calls them atomic habits.In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes.

Mi ha mostrato che la vita ? tutta una questione di punti di vista: a seconda di come la guardi, la tua esistenza pu? essere bella o brutta, giusta o sbagliata, fortunata o sfortunata. Prima di volerla cambiare, dobbiamo essere noi a guardarla con occhi diversi, pi? consapevoli.

<p>Summary : &#8220;Il mondo l? fuori, con il suo rumore e il suo caos, prover? sempre a entrarti dentro. Arriveranno pensieri nuovi, difficili da affrontare. Non affrontarli, allora. Torna all&#8217;origine: calma la mente. Sdraiati su un prato e guarda lass?. Tu non sei le nuvole, che vanno e vengono e sono sempre in movimento. Tu sei il cielo. E il cielo ? leggero proprio perch? non trattiene niente. Il cielo ? saggio. Sa lasciare andare ci? che lo attraversa. Se vuoi essere sereno come un buddha, non essere una nuvola. Sii il cielo. Il buddhismo ? stato la mia guarigione. Mi ha mostrato che la vita ? tutta una questione di punti di vista: a seconda di come la guardi, la tua esistenza pu? essere bella o brutta, giusta o sbagliata, fortunata o sfortunata. Prima di volerla cambiare, dobbiamo essere noi a guardarla con occhi diversi, pi? consapevoli. Dobbiamo essere noi a cambiare. ? stato proprio attraverso questo processo che il buddhismo mi ha aiutato a trasformare il periodo pi? difficile della mia vita </p>

<p>Summary : A novel of family, secrets, ghosts, and homecoming set on the seaside cliffs of Maine, by the New York Times best-selling author of Friends and Strangers.On a secluded bluff overlooking the ocean sits a Victorian house, lavender with gingerbread trim, a home that contains a century?s worth of secrets. By the time Jane Flanagan discovers the house as a teenager, it has long been abandoned. The place is an irresistible mystery to Jane. There are still clothes in the closets, marbles rolling across the floors, and dishes in the cupboards, even though no one has set foot there in decades. The house becomes a hideaway for Jane, a place to escape her volatile mother.Twenty years later, now a Harvard archivist, she returns home to Maine following a terrible mistake that threatens both her career and her marriage. Jane is horrified to find the Victorian is now barely recognizable. The new owner, Genevieve, a summer person from Beacon Hill, has gutted it, transforming the house into a glossy </p>

<p>Summary : Three more stories of magical mayhem in one beautifully produced book! Granny decides to liven things up during the school play and turns Noah&#8217;s Ark into Noah&#8217;s Pirate Ship, before making it rain in the school hall! When Pandora&#8217;s parents decide to build a new bedroom for her over the garage, Granny decides to lend a hand. Why build a boring extension when you can build a fairytale castle? But it&#8217;s during an outbreak of nits at Pandora&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s wedding that Granny truly comes into her own&#8230;</p>

The second woman ever hired for the role of Death Investigator in Manhattan, she was the first to last more than three months. The work was gritty, demanding, morbid, and sometimes dangerous?and she loved it.

For him, it&#8217;s the pain of growing up between Korea and Germany, being torn between two cultures and languages.Greek Lessons is a tender love letter to human connection, a novel to awaken the senses, vividly conjuring the essence of what it means to be alive.Translated by Deborah Smith and Emily Yae Won.__________________&#8217;Another stunning gem: </p>

<p>Summary : ?Listening Length = 16 hours and 46 minutesThe powerful and moving memoir of a fearless political opposition leader who paid the ultimate price for his beliefs.Alexei Navalny began writing Patriot shortly after his near-fatal poisoning in 2020. It is the full story of his life: his youth, his call to activism, his marriage and family, his commitment to challenging a world super-power determined to silence him, and his total conviction that change cannot be resisted?and will come.In vivid, compelling detail, including never-before-seen correspondence from prison, Navalny recounts, among other things, his political career, the many attempts on his life, and the lives of the people closest to him, and the relentless campaign he and his team waged against an increasingly dictatorial regime.Written with the passion, wit, candor, and bravery for which he was justly acclaimed, Patriot is Navalny?s final letter to the world: a moving account of his last years spent in the most brutal prison </p>

<p>Summary : Middle age can be murder &#8230;  At least that?s how it seems to former crime journalist, Wilhelmina Chance, whose near-fatal accident has given her a strange side effect &#8230; she sees ghosts.  After a messy divorce sends her fleeing back to her hometown of Mystic Notch, nestled in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Willa finds herself haunted by the tenacious ghost of the town librarian who insists Willa solve her murder.  Luckily, she has lots of help, including a quirky cast of small-town characters, the cat she?s inherited from her grandmother, and her best friend, Pepper, who claims her herbal teas can work magic.  But just when Willa thinks she?s discovered who the killer is, she finds out that things are not what they seem in Mystic Notch, and the case takes a strange turn that has Willa adding even some of her long-time friends to her suspect list.  Can Willa find the real killer in time to keep the magical balance in Mystic Notch on the side of good, or will evil prevail?</p>

<p>Summary : A &#8220;girl-meets-God&#8221; style memoir of an agnostic who, through her surprising opportunity to study at Oxford, comes to a dynamic personal faith in God.Carolyn Weber arrives for graduate study at Oxford University as a feminist from a loving but broken family, suspicious of men and intellectually hostile to all things religious. As she grapples with her God-shaped void alongside the friends, classmates, and professors she meets, she tackles big questions in search of love and a life that matters.

This savvy, beautifully written, credible account of Christian conversion follows the calendar and events of the school year as it entertains, informs, and promises to engage even the most skeptical and unlikely reader.</p>

<p>Summary : The first story Selma Blair Beitner ever heard about herself is that she was a mean, mean baby. With her mouth pulled in a perpetual snarl and a head so furry it had to be rubbed to make way for her forehead, Selma spent years living up to her terrible reputation: biting her sisters, lying spontaneously, getting drunk from Passover wine at the age of seven, and behaving dramatically so that she would be the center of attention. Although Selma went on to become a celebrated Hollywood actress and model, she could never quite shake the periods of darkness that overtook her, the certainty that there was a great mystery at the heart of her life. She often felt like her arms might be on fire, a sensation not unlike electric shocks, and she secretly drank to escape. Over the course of this beautiful and, at times, devasting memoir, Selma lays bare her addiction to alcohol, her devotion to her brilliant and complicated mother, and the moments she flirted with death. There is brutal violence, </p>
