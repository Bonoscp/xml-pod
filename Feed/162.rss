They?re going to buff the salt from its windows, paint its sun-bleached sidings, and open it as a bed and breakfast.

Just when true happiness seems within reach, Callie and Olivia find a diary full of secrets&#8230; secrets that stretch across the island, and have the power to turn lives upside down.

They?re going to buff the salt from its windows, paint its sun-bleached sidings, and open it as a bed and breakfast.  Callie?s too busy to think about her love life, but when she catches the attention of local heartthrob Luke Sullivan, his blue eyes and easy smile make it hard to say no.

<p>Summary : Target: Trump. Even before a would-be killer tried to murder President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, a clique of political assassins set about eliminating him from public life entirely. In Disappearing the President, New York Times bestselling author Lee Smith exposes how a shadow network of powerful partisan activists has waged a years-long, scorched-earth war to eradicate President Trump and any vestige of his influence. Resorting to an unprecedented campaign of domestic spying, election rigging, brute-force censorship, and political violence, anti-Trump zealots have undermined the federal government and sabotaged countless other vital institutions in their relentless quest to crush the former president. In this alarming book, Lee Smith reveals:* How U.S. intelligence services, trained to sabotage foreign governments and leaders, have turned their expertise against Americans.*How the Shadow Network exploited Covid to censor dissidents and rig the 2020 election.*Why Big Tech firms </p>

<p>Summary : In Rough Sleepers, Tracy Kidder shows how one person can make a difference, as he tells the story of Dr. Jim O?Connell, a man who invented ways to create a community of care for a city?s unhoused population, including those who sleep on the streets?the ?rough sleepers.?  When Jim O?Connell graduated from Harvard Medical School and was nearing the end of his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, the chief of medicine made a proposal: Would he defer a prestigious fellowship and spend a year helping to create an organization to bring health care to homeless citizens? Jim took the job because he felt he couldn?t refuse. But that year turned into his life?s calling. Tracy Kidder spent five years following Dr. O?Connell and his colleagues as they served their thousands of homeless patients.

He emphasizes a </p>

<p>Summary : ?Carlotta mia, io dell?arancio amaro conosco solo le spine e ormai non mi fanno pi? male. Ma il profumo del suo fiore bianco ? il tuo, ? quello della libert?.? A cosa serve essere giovane e piena di progetti, se sei nata nel tempo sbagliato? Tre protagoniste straordinarie fronteggiano la sfida pi? grande: trovare il senso del proprio essere donne in un mondo che vorrebbe scegliere al posto loro. Nardina, dolce e paziente, che sogna di laurearsi ma finisce intrappolata nel ruolo di moglie. Sabedda, selvatica e fiera, che vorrebbe poter decidere il proprio futuro ma ? troppo povera per poterlo fare. Carlotta, orgogliosa e determinata, che vorrebbe diventare avvocato in un mondo dove solo i maschi ritengono di poter esercitare la professione. E un segreto, che affonda nella notte in cui i loro destini si sono uniti per sempre. Tra gli anni Venti e gli anni Sessanta del Novecento, Sabedda, Nardina e Carlotta lottano e amano sullo sfondo di un mondo che cambia, che attraversa il Fascismo </p>

<p>Summary : Die Stadtmaus ist in den Wald gekommen, um die Haselmaus zu besuchen. Und was hat sie im Gep?ck? Ein ganzes Fest!

Sie backen Pl?tzchen, reimen Gedichte, suchen den perfekten Baum und basteln den wunderbarsten Weihnachtsschmuck. Aber das Sch?nste ist der Weihnachtszauber ? denn der erfasst nicht nur den kleinen Siebenschl?fer, sondern alle Tiere im Wald.</p>

<p>Summary : A stirring consideration of homeownership, fatherhood, race, faith, and the history of an American cityIn 2016, Lawrence Jackson accepted a new job in Baltimore, searched for schools for his sons, and bought a house. It would all be unremarkable but for the fact that he had grown up in West Baltimore and now found himself teaching at Johns Hopkins, whose vexed relationship to its neighborhood, to the city and its history, provides fodder for this captivating memoir in essays.With sardonic wit, Jackson describes his struggle to make a home in the city that had just been convulsed by the uprising that followed the murder of Freddie Gray. His new neighborhood, Homeland?largely White, built on racial covenants?is not where he is ?supposed? to live. But his purchase, and his desire to pass some inheritance on to his children, provides a foundation for him to explore his personal and spiritual history, as well as Baltimore?s untold stories. Each chapter is a new exploration: a trip to the </p>

Mothers, Fathers, and Others is a polymath?s journey into urgent questions about familial love and hate, human prejudice and cruelty, and the transformative power of art. This moving, fierce, and often funny book is finally </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;Ik wil dit eigenlijk niet weten,&#8217; krijgt onderzoeksjournalist Huib Modderkolk regelmatig te horen wanneer hij vertelt over de gevaren van moderne technologie. Diezelfde houding treft hij bij bedrijven en de overheid. Als hij zelf doelwit wordt van een inlichtingenoperatie, ondervindt Modderkolk de gevolgen van die na?eve opstelling. Zijn daaropvolgende onderzoek brengt hem bij mensen die, soms met gevaar voor eigen leven, stap voor stap laten zien dat internet een magnifiek wapen is. Van Den Haag tot Sint Petersburg en van Eindhoven tot Teheran stuit hij op angstaanjagende verhalen die normaal verborgen blijven. Zo ontdekt hij waar onze meest intieme data belanden, waarom Nederland een risicovol detectiesysteem verspreidde en hoe ver China wereldwijd is doordrongen in kritieke systemen. Dit wil je ?cht niet weten is &#8211; net als Modderkolks alom geprezen bestseller Het is oorlog maar niemand die het ziet &#8211; een bloedstollende pageturner over de schaduwkanten van de online samenleving.</p>

<p>Summary : In this memoir, acclaimed New Yorker staff writer Tad Friend reflects on the pressures of middle age, exploring his relationship with his dying father as he raises two children of his own.Almost everyone yearns to know their parents more thoroughly before they die, to solve some of those lifelong mysteries. Maybe, just maybe, those answers will help you live your own life. But life doesn&#8217;t stop to wait. In his fifties, New Yorker writer Tad Friend is grappling with being a husband and a father as he tries to grasp who he is as a son. Torn between two families, he careens between two stages in life. On some days he feels vigorous, on the brink of greatness when he plays tournament squash. On others, he feels distinctly weary, troubled by his distance from millennial sensibilities or by his own face in the mirror, by a grimace that&#8217;s so like his father&#8217;s.His father, an erudite historian and the former president of Swarthmore College, has long been gregarious and charming with strangers </p>

<p>Summary : In this memoir, acclaimed New Yorker staff writer Tad Friend reflects on the pressures of middle age, exploring his relationship with his dying father as he raises two children of his own.Almost everyone yearns to know their parents more thoroughly before they die, to solve some of those lifelong mysteries. Maybe, just maybe, those answers will help you live your own life. But life doesn&#8217;t stop to wait. In his fifties, New Yorker writer Tad Friend is grappling with being a husband and a father as he tries to grasp who he is as a son. Torn between two families, he careens between two stages in life. On some days he feels vigorous, on the brink of greatness when he plays tournament squash. On others, he feels distinctly weary, troubled by his distance from millennial sensibilities or by his own face in the mirror, by a grimace that&#8217;s so like his father&#8217;s.His father, an erudite historian and the former president of Swarthmore College, has long been gregarious and charming with strangers </p>

But after pulverizing the heroes there, he just leaves. What the heck does this guy want?! Meanwhile, Class-B, Rank-1 Miss Blizzard visits Saitama at his apartment.

<p>Summary : Inconvenient monster alarms, a sparkly array of princess guests, and spot-on slapstick pacing make for a party readers will celebrate.Today is Princess Magnolia?s birthday party, and she wants everything to be perfect. But just as her guests are arriving . . . Brring! Brring! The monster alarm! Princess Magnolia runs to the broom closet, ditches her frilly clothes, and becomes the Princess in Black! She rushes to the goat pasture, defeats the monster, and returns to the castle before her guests discover her secret. But every time Princess Magnolia is about to open her presents, the monster alarm rings again. And every time she rushes back?an inside-out dress here, a missing shoe there?it gets harder to keep the other princesses from being suspicious. Don?t those monsters understand that now is not a good time for an attack?</p>

<p>Summary : Melissa Gould?s hopeful memoir of grieving outside the box and the surprising nature of love.When Melissa Gould&#8217;s husband, Joel, was unexpectedly hospitalized, she could not imagine how her life was about to change. Overwhelmed as his condition tragically worsened, she had to believe that while Joel?s loss was permanent, so was their love.Left to raise their young daughter on her own, and to act as if she could resume life without her beloved husband by her side, Melissa found that she didn?t fit the typical idea of widowhood or meet the expectations of mourning.

<p>Summary :  Cynicism is making us sick; Stanford Psychologist Dr. Jamil Zaki has the cure?a ?ray of light for dark days? (Adam Grant, #1 New York Times bestselling author).?  ?For thousands of years, people have argued about whether humanity is selfish or generous, cruel or kind. But recently, our answers have changed. In 1972, half of Americans agreed that most people can be trusted; by 2018, that figure had fallen to 30%. Different generations, genders, religions, and political parties can?t seem to agree on anything, except that they all think human virtue is evaporating.  Cynicism is a perfectly understandable response to a world full of injustice and inequality. But in many cases, cynicism is misplaced. Dozens of studies find that people fail to realize how kind, generous, and open-minded others really are.

<p>Summary :  Cynicism is making us sick; Stanford Psychologist Dr. Jamil Zaki has the cure?a ?ray of light for dark days? (Adam Grant, #1 New York Times bestselling author).?  ?For thousands of years, people have argued about whether humanity is selfish or generous, cruel or kind. But recently, our answers have changed. In 1972, half of Americans agreed that most people can be trusted; by 2018, that figure had fallen to 30%. Different generations, genders, religions, and political parties can?t seem to agree on anything, except that they all think human virtue is evaporating.  Cynicism is a perfectly understandable response to a world full of injustice and inequality. But in many cases, cynicism is misplaced. Dozens of studies find that people fail to realize how kind, generous, and open-minded others really are. And cynical thinking worsens social problems, because our beliefs don?t just interpret the world?they change it. When we expect people to be awful, we coax awfulness out of them. </p>

<p>Summary : John Green, the #1 bestselling author of The Fault in Our Stars is back, with a book hailed by the Guardian as &#8216;a new modern classic&#8217;. &#8216;It&#8217;s quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.&#8217; Sixteen-year-old Aza never intended to pursue the mystery of fugitive billionaire Russell Pickett, but there&#8217;s a hundred thousand dollar reward at stake and her Best and Most Fearless Friend, Daisy, is eager to investigate. So together, they navigate the short distance and broad divides that separate them from Russell Pickett&#8217;s son, Davis. Aza is trying. She is trying to be a good daughter, a good friend, a good student, and maybe even a good detective, while also living within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts. In his long-awaited return, John Green, the acclaimed, award-winning author of Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars, shares Aza&#8217;s story with shattering, unflinching clarity in this brilliant novel of love, resilience, and the power of lifelong friendship. </p>

<p>Summary : Written in Greek by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, without any intention of publication, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. While the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>Summary : ?While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I?ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.? ? from the PrologueMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.The Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history.

<p>Summary : Tariq Ali has been a British national treasure for almost five decades. Revolutionary, writer, broadcaster, filmmaker, polemicist&#8211;fighter in the street&#8211;and general all-round trouble-maker (in the nicest possible sense), he&#8217;s been them all, and usually at the same time. Since 1990 Ali has also worked in fiction, firstly with Redemption, and now with a planned quartet of historical novels, of which The Book of Saladin is the second.

It shows us the conflict between Christian and Islamic civilizations set to a sometimes bawdy, sometimes brutal background where all of life is in flux. As in his previous novel, Ali shows the depth and breadth of his learning and humanity on every page. Like his central character, Saladin, or Salah-al-Din (the Kurdish liberator of </p>

Solo escribi? una obra: Meditaciones, uno de los mejores libros de filosof?a y ?tica de la historia. Se trata de un compendio de sabidur?a y reflexi?n para afrontar los tiempos adversos.

<p>Summary : Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father?s dive bar&#8230; in Washington.Piper hasn?t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won?t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can?t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She?s determined to show her stepfather?and the hot, grumpy local?that she?s more than a pretty face.Except it?s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there?s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. </p>

<p>Summary : From National Book Award-nominee Iliana Regan, a new memoir of her life and heritage as a forager, spanning her ancestry in Eastern Europe, her childhood in rural Indiana, and her new life set in the remote forests of Michigan&#8217;s Upper Peninsula. Fieldwork explores how Regan&#8217;s complex gender identity informs her acclaimed work as a chef and her profound experience of the natural world.Not long after Iliana Regan&#8217;s celebrated debut, Burn the Place, became the first food-related title in four decades to become a National Book Award nominee in 2019, her career as a Michelin star-winning chef took a sharp turn north. Long based in Chicago, she and her new wife, Anna, decided to create a culinary destination, the Milkweed Inn, located in Michigan&#8217;s remote Upper Peninsula, where much of the food served to their guests would be foraged by Regan herself in the surrounding forest and nearby river. Part fresh challenge, part escape, Regan&#8217;s move to the forest was also a return to her rural </p>

<p>Summary : The man Jason Bourne fishes out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot-and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad?s most feared killer. Do the answers to these mysteries lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago?The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo.In the course of Bourne?s desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same.Now everything turns on the amnesiac.

<p>Summary : For the first time, Pope Francis tells the story of his life as he looks back on the momentous world events that have changed history?from his earliest years during the outbreak of World War II in 1939 to the turmoil of today.?An extraordinary personal and historical journey, Life is the story of a man and a world in dramatic change. Pope Francis recalls his life through memories and observations of the most significant occurrences of the past eight decades, from the Holocaust to the fall of the Berlin Wall, Videla?s coup in Argentina to the moon landing in 1969, and even the 1986 World Cup in which Maradona scored the unforgettable ?hand of God? goal.Here are the frank assessments and intimate insights of a pastor reflecting on the Nazi extermination of the Jews, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the 2001 terrorist attack on America and the collapse of the Twin Towers, the great economic recession of 2008, the Covid-19 pandemic, the retirement of Pope Benedict XVI, and </p>

<p>Summary : For precocious 11-year-old Lea Ypi, Albania?s Soviet-style socialism held the promise of a preordained future, a guarantee of security among enthusiastic comrades. That is, until she found herself clinging to a stone statue of Joseph Stalin, newly beheaded by student protests.Communism had failed to deliver the promised utopia. One?s ?biography??class status and other associations long in the past?put strict boundaries around one?s individual future. When Lea?s parents spoke of relatives going to ?university? or ?graduating,? they were speaking of grave secrets Lea struggled to unveil. And when the early ?90s saw Albania and other Balkan countries exuberantly begin a transition to the ?free market,? Western ideals of freedom delivered chaos: a dystopia of pyramid schemes, organized crime, and sex trafficking.With her elegant, intellectual, French-speaking grandmother; her radical-chic father; and her staunchly anti-socialist, Thatcherite mother to guide her through these disorienting </p>

<p>Summary : La s?bita aparici?n de un virus letal que ataca a los animales modifica de manera irreversible el mundo: desde las fieras hasta las mascotas deben ser sistem?ticamente sacrificadas, y su carne ya no puede ser consumida. Los gobiernos enfrentan la situaci?n con una decisi?n dr?stica: legalizando la cr?a, reproducci?n, matanza y procesamiento de carne humana. El canibalismo es ley y la sociedad ha quedado dividida en dos grupos: los que comen y los que son comidos. Marcos Tejo, encargado general del frigor?fico Krieg, es un oscuro bur?crata. El d?a en que recibe como regalo una mujer criada para el consumo, las tentaciones lo transforman en una conciencia peligrosa de pliegues truculentos que lo llevar? a transgredir las nuevas normas hasta l?mites que la sociedad ignora. En esta despiadada distop?a ?tan brutal como sutil, tan aleg?rica como realista?, Bazterrica inspira, con el poder explosivo de la ficci?n, debates de suma actualidad.</p>

<p>Summary : Lauren Groff returns with her exhilarating first new novel since the groundbreaking Fates and Furies.Cast out of the royal court by Eleanor of Aquitaine, deemed too coarse and rough-hewn for marriage or courtly life, 17-year-old Marie de France is sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey, its nuns on the brink of starvation and beset by disease.At first taken aback by the severity of her new life, Marie finds focus and love in collective life with her singular and mercurial sisters. In this crucible, Marie steadily supplants her desire for family, for her homeland, for the passions of her youth with something new to her: devotion to her sisters, and a conviction in her own divine visions. Marie, born the last in a long line of women warriors and crusaders, is determined to chart a bold new course for the women she now leads and protects.

<p>Summary : Lauren Groff returns with her exhilarating first new novel since the groundbreaking Fates and Furies.Cast out of the royal court by Eleanor of Aquitaine, deemed too coarse and rough-hewn for marriage or courtly life, 17-year-old Marie de France is sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey, its nuns on the brink of starvation and beset by disease.At first taken aback by the severity of her new life, Marie finds focus and love in collective life with her singular and mercurial sisters.

But in a world that is shifting and corroding in frightening ways, one that can never reconcile itself with her existence, </p>

<p>Summary : Billionaire Ian Shaw can have everything he wants?except a happy ending. Or at least that&#8217;s what it feels like with his fortune recently liquidated, his niece, Esme, still missing, and the woman he loves refusing to speak to him. In fact, he doubts she would date him even if they were stranded on a deserted island.Despite her love for Ian, Sierra Rose knows he has no room in his life for her as long as the mystery of his missing niece goes unsolved. The only problem is, Sierra has solved it, but a promise to Esme to keep her whereabouts secret has made it impossible to be around Ian.When the PEAK chopper is damaged and Sierra lacks the funds to repair it, Ian offers a fundraising junket for large donors on his yacht in the Caribbean. But the three-day excursion turns into a nightmare when a rogue wave cripples the yacht and sends the passengers overboard. Shaken up and soaked to the bone, Ian finally has a chance to test his theory when he and Sierra do indeed find themselves washed </p>

<p>Summary : ?Do you like green eggs and ham?? asks Sam-I-am in this Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss. In a house or with a mouse? In a boat or with a goat? On a train or in a tree? Sam keeps asking persistently. With unmistakable characters and signature rhymes, Dr. Seuss?s beloved favorite has cemented its place as a children?s classic. In this most famous of cumulative tales, the list of places to enjoy green eggs and ham, and friends to enjoy them with, gets longer and longer. Follow Sam-I-am as he insists that this unusual treat is indeed a delectable snack to be savored everywhere and in every way. Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.</p>
