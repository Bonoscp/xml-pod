To ensure peaceful co-existence and inherit their legacy, human children of these families must study at an elite university before choosing a vampire companion.Lost Heiress, Kidan Adane grew up far from Uxlay University. She is obsessively protective, mildly nihilistic, and willing to do anything to save her loved ones. When her sister, June, disappears, Kidan is convinced a vampire stole her &#8211; the alluring yet dangerous Susenyos Sagad, the same vampire bound to her own House.To stay in Uxlay, Kidan must study an arcane philosophy, work with four enigmatic students, and survive living with Susenyos &#8211; even as he does everything to drive her away. It doesn&#8217;t matter that Susenyos&#8217; violence speaks to her own and tempts Kidan to surrender to a life of darkness. She must find her sister and kill him at all costs.When </p>

<p>Summary : After a lifetime of bounties and bloodshed, Viv is hanging up her sword for the last time.The battle-weary orc aims to start fresh, opening the first ever coffee shop in the city of Thune. But old and new rivals stand in the way of success ? not to mention the fact that no one has the faintest idea what coffee actually is.If Viv wants to put the blade behind her and make her plans a reality, she won&#8217;t be able to go it alone.But the true rewards of the uncharted path are the travelers you meet along the way. And whether drawn together by ancient magic, flaky pastry, or a freshly brewed cup, they may become partners, family, and something deeper than she ever could have dreamed.</p>

<p>Summary : A masterpiece of contemporary American fiction, Demon Copperhead captures the heart as it evokes a young hero&#8217;s unforgettable journey to maturity in the mountains of southern Appalachia.Demon Copperhead is the story of a boy born to a teenage single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father&#8217;s good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, Demon braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. </p>

<p>Summary : Can you flimflam a ghost? It?s 1934. Former medium Dashiel Quicke travels the country debunking spiritualism and false mediums while struggling to stay ahead of his ex-business partner and lover who wants him back at any cost. During a demonstration at a college campus, Dashiel meets Hermann Goschalk, an Egyptologist who?s convinced that he has a genuine haunted artifact on his hands. Certain there is a rational explanation for whatever is going on with Hermann?s relics, Dashiel would rather skip town, but soon finds himself falling for Hermann. He agrees to take a look after all and learns that something is haunting Hermann?s office indeed. Faced with a real ghost Dashiel is terrified, but when the haunting takes a dangerous turn, he must use the tools of the shady trade he left behind to communicate with this otherworldly spirit before his past closes in. For readers who enjoy A Marvellous Light by Freya Marske, The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune, and Malice by Heather Walter</p>

<p>Summary : Can you flimflam a ghost? It?s 1934. Former medium Dashiel Quicke travels the country debunking spiritualism and false mediums while struggling to stay ahead of his ex-business partner and lover who wants him back at any cost. During a demonstration at a college campus, Dashiel meets Hermann Goschalk, an Egyptologist who?s convinced that he has a genuine haunted artifact on his hands. Certain there is a rational explanation for whatever is going on with Hermann?s relics, Dashiel would rather skip town, but soon finds himself falling for Hermann. He agrees to take a look after all and learns that something is haunting Hermann?s office indeed. Faced with a real ghost Dashiel is terrified, but when the haunting takes a dangerous turn, he must use the tools of the shady trade he left behind to communicate with this otherworldly spirit before his past closes in.

<p>Summary : Melody faces her fears to follow her passion in this sequel to Out of My Mind.Melody is a year older, and a year braver. And now with her Medi-talker, she feels nothing?s out of her reach, not even summer camp. There have to be camps for differently-abled kids like her, and she?s going to sleuth one out. A place where she can trek through a forest, fly on a zip line, and even ride on a horse! A place where maybe she really can finally make a real friend, make her own decisions, and even do things on her own?the dream!  By the light of flickering campfires and the power of thunderstorms, through the terror of unexpected creatures in cabins and the first sparkle of a crush, Melody?s about to discover how brave and strong she really is.</p>

<p>Summary : A poetic and raw coming-of-age memoir in essays about blackness, masculinity, and addictionPunch Me Up to the Gods introduces a powerful new talent in Brian Broome, whose early years growing up in Ohio as a dark-skinned Black boy harboring crushes on other boys propel forward this gorgeous, aching, and unforgettable debut. Brian&#8217;s recounting of his experiences&#8211;in all their cringe-worthy, hilarious, and heartbreaking glory&#8211;reveal a perpetual outsider awkwardly squirming to find his way in. Indiscriminate sex and escalating drug use help to soothe his hurt, young psyche, usually to uproarious and devastating effect. A no-nonsense mother and broken father play crucial roles in our misfit&#8217;s origin story. But it is Brian&#8217;s voice in the retelling that shows the true depth of vulnerability for young Black boys that is often quietly near to bursting at the seams.

<p>Summary : When it comes to the trials and triumphs of becoming a grown up, journalist and former Sunday Times dating columnist Dolly Alderton has seen and tried it all. In her memoir, she vividly recounts falling in love, wrestling with self-sabotage, finding a job, throwing a socially disastrous Rod-Stewart themed house party, getting drunk, getting dumped, realising that Ivan from the corner shop is the only man you&#8217;ve ever been able to rely on, and finding that that your mates are always there at the end of every messy night out. It&#8217;s a book about bad dates, good friends and &#8211; above all else &#8211; about recognising that you and you alone are enough.Glittering with wit and insight, heart and humour, Dolly Alderton&#8217;s powerful d?but weaves together personal stories, satirical observations, a series of lists, recipes, and other vignettes that will strike a chord of recognition with women of every age &#8211; while making you laugh until you fall over. Everything I know About Love is about the struggles </p>

As a scholarship student at a private university on the East Coast, no longer the only Korean she knew, she found community and a path to the life she&#8217;d long wanted. But the middle class world she begins to raise a family in ? where there are big homes, college funds, nice vacations ? looks very different from the middle class world she thought she grew up in, where paychecks have to stretch to the end of the week, health insurance is often lacking, and </p>

<p>Summary : Booker Prize-shortlisted and New York Times bestselling author Paul Auster&#8217;s comprehensive, landmark biography of the great American writer Stephen Crane.With Burning Boy, celebrated novelist Paul Auster tells the extraordinary story of Stephen Crane, best known as the author of The Red Badge of Courage, who transformed American literature through an avalanche of original short stories, novellas, poems, journalism, and war reportage before his life was cut short by tuberculosis at age twenty-eight.Auster?s probing account of this singular life tracks Crane as he rebounds from one perilous situation to the next: A controversial article written at twenty disrupts the course of the 1892 presidential campaign, a public battle with the New York police department over the false arrest of a prostitute effectively exiles him from the city, a star-crossed love affair with an unhappily married uptown girl tortures him, a common-law marriage to the proprietress of Jacksonville?s most elegant </p>

<p>Summary : The wrath of God lies sleeping. It was hid a million years before men were and only men have power to wake it. Hell aint half full.Set in the anarchic world opened up by America?s westward expansion, Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy is an epic and potent account of the barbarous violence that man visits upon man. Through the hostile landscape of the Texas?Mexico border wanders the Kid, a fourteen year-old Tennessean who is quickly swept up in the relentless tide of blood. But the apparent chaos is not without its order: while Americans hunt Indians ? collecting scalps as their bloody trophies ? they too are stalked as prey.Since its first publication in 1985, Blood Meridian has been read as both a brilliant subversion of the Western novel and a blazing example of that form. Powerful, mesmerizing and savagely beautiful, it is established as one of the most important works in American fiction of the last century.</p>

<p>Summary : Com A estepe, pela primeira vez Anton Tch?khov, aos 28 anos e j? com vasta quilometragem como colaborador de jornais e revistas liter?rias, tentou produzir uma narrativa mais extensa. Tarefa desafiadora mas, como se l? hoje, bem-sucedida. O subt?tulo parece sintetizar a situa??o central: a viagem de um menino que parte para estudar em outra cidade e, para isso, percorre alguns dias pela vasta estepe russa. Mas tamb?m apresenta o car?ter m?ltiplo do texto: um relato da experi?ncia, uma narrativa ficcional, um estudo de tipos humanos, a pintura da natureza, al?m de retratos das atividades econ?micas, das rela??es sociais e das mudan?as de comportamento em curso.</p>

<p>Summary : Having set global warming in irreversible motion, we are facing the possibility of ecological catastrophe. But the environmental emergency is also a crisis for our philosophical habits of thought, confronting us with a problem that seems to defy not only our control but also our understanding. Global warming is perhaps the most dramatic example of what Timothy Morton calls ?hyperobjects??entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place. In this book, Morton explains what hyperobjects are and their impact on how we think, how we coexist with one another and with nonhumans, and how we experience our politics, ethics, and art.Moving fluidly between philosophy, science, literature, visual and conceptual art, and popular culture, the book argues that hyperobjects show that the end of the world has already occurred in the sense that concepts such as world, nature, and even environment are no longer a </p>

<p>Summary : You can bury the bodies, but you can?t hide the truth.When a landslip on Pembrokeshire?s stunning coastal path reveals the harrowing remains of two bodies, ex-DCI Evan Warlow?s quiet retirement is shattered.As the original investigator for the two missing persons eight years before, Evan is recalled to help with what is now a murder inquiry.

<p>Summary : Carter Beckett is the NHL&#8217;s resident batboy, top player both on the ice &amp; in the bedroom, and quite possibly the sexiest man to ever grace my field of vision. But worst of all? He knows it.He?s arrogant, self-centered, and the man doesn?t seem to know what a filter is, let alone how to use one. He?s had everything served to him on a silver platter, including endless strings of women, and apparently, I?m up next. His only problem? I have no intention of falling for his shi?um, charm. I have the solution to all my sexual frustrations in a drawer at home, and it?s far less complicated than Carter Beckett. Sure, he may be pretty, but he?s also a walking, talking reminder for you to wrap it before you tap it. But then I start letting my guard down, and he starts showing me pieces of himself I had no intention of seeing. The bricks surrounding me may be tumbling down one by one, but I?m not sold yet, which means for the first time in his life, Carter?s the one begging. For my time, my </p>

They certainly did not expect them to FALL.As an assassin for the rebellion group F?ur du Ath, Raeve?s job is to complete orders and never get caught.

Now on a tireless quest to quell the never-ebbing ache in his chest, a clue lures him into the capitol?s high-security prison where he stumbles upon the imprisoned Raeve ?Echoes of the past race between them.There?s more to their story than meets the eye, but some truths are too poisonous to swallow.The bestselling phenomenon,?When the Moon Hatched, is a </p>

<p>Summary : In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of &#8220;outliers&#8221;&#8211;the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.Listening actual time: 7 hours and 22 minutes</p>

<p>Summary : A riveting, whistleblowing narrative that illuminates the often-secret and underhand dealings of the modern art world.Several years ago Richard Dorment, Chief Art for the Daily Telegraph in London, was approached by Joe Simon, a wealthy American art connoisseur who was deeply unhappy that his collection of Warhols had been pronounced as fakes by the secretive Warhol Authentication Board. Dorment explained to Simon that whatever the rights and wrongs of his case, as neither scholar nor gallerist, Dorment could be of no use to him. But Simon would not give up and eventually Dorment agreed to meet with him.  To his surprise, Dorment was intrigued both by Simon and the story he had to tell; over the ensuing years, he found himself drawn into a complex story of intrigue and corruption that raised fascinating issues about art, its value, the significance of attribution, and how issues of aesthetics and financial worth interact and collide. This is the story of how Richard Dorment uncovered </p>

Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty?s ship The Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain.?While chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon, The Wager was wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The crew, marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing 2,500 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes.Then, six months later, another, even more decrepit, craft landed on the coast of Chile.

<p>Summary : A story of shipwreck, mutiny and murder, culminating in a court martial?that reveals a shocking truth.On 28th January 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell.

The crew, marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing 2,500 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes.Then, six months later, another, even more decrepit, craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways and they had a very different story to tell.?The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not </p>

<p>Summary : Robert E. Howard is famous for creating such immortal heroes as Conan the Cimmerian, Solomon Kane, and Bran Mak Morn. Less well-known but equally extraordinary are his non-fantasy adventure stories set in the Middle East and featuring such two-fisted heroes as Francis Xavier Gordon?known as ?El Borak??Kirby O?Donnell, and Steve Clarney. This trio of hard-fighting Americans, civilized men with more than a touch of the primordial in their veins, marked a new direction for Howard?s writing, and new territory for his genius to conquer.The wily Texan El Borak, a hardened fighter who stalks the sandscapes of Afghanistan like a vengeful wolf, is rivaled among Howard?s creations only by Conan himself. In such classic tales as ?The Daughter of Erlik Khan,? ?Three-Bladed Doom,? and ?Sons of the Hawk,? Howard proves himself once again a master of action, and with plenty of eerie atmosphere his plotting becomes tighter and twistier than ever, resulting in stories worthy of comparison to Jack </p>

<p>Summary : When her twenty-five-year marriage unexpectedly falls apart, journalist Florence Williams expects the loss to hurt. What she doesn?t expect is that she?ll end up in the hospital, examining close-up the way our cells listen to loneliness. She travels to the frontiers of the science of ?social pain? to learn why heartbreak hurts so much and why so much of the conventional wisdom about it is wrong.Searching for insight as well as personal strategies to game her way back to health, Williams tests her blood for genetic markers of grief, undergoes electrical shocks in a laboratory while looking at pictures of her ex, and ventures to the wilderness in search of awe as an antidote to loneliness. For readers of Wild and Lab Girl, Heartbreak is a remarkable merging of science and self-discovery that will change the way we think about loneliness, health, and what it means to fall in and out of love.</p>

<p>Summary : A New York Times Bestseller!The Sandman is the universally lauded masterwork following Morpheus, Lord of the Dreaming&#8211;a vast hallucinatory landscape housing all the dreams of any and everyone who&#8217;s ever existed. Regardless of cultures or historical eras, all dreamers visit Morpheus&#8217; realm&#8211;be they gods, demons, muses, mythical creatures, or simply humans who teach Morpheus some surprising lessons.Upon his escape from an embarrassing captivity at the hands of a mere mortal, Morpheus finds himself at a crossroads, forced to deal with the enormous changes within both himself and his realm. His journey to find his place in a world that&#8217;s drastically changed takes him through mythical worlds to retrieve his old heirlooms, the back roads of America for a twisted reunion, and even Hell itself&#8211;to receive the dubious honor of picking the next Devil. But he&#8217;ll learn his greatest lessons at the hands of his own family, the Endless, who&#8211;like him&#8211;are walking embodiments of the most </p>

<p>Summary : The sensational conclusion to Crave series?It?s been over three months since my friends and I took down Cyrus. Three months where my biggest fear was what paper was due next&#8230; But I should have known it was too good to last. Now everything is falling apart.The Vampire Court has no king, the Dragon Court has no heart, and the Gargoyle Court has me?a teenager in way over her head. And it?s the worst possible timing, because a threat is brewing just as the Circle is collapsing.I have no choice but to return to the Shadow Realm and face the terrifying queen who nearly ended us?and make a deal with her to save Mekhi. But this time, I?m bringing my powerful friends with me?and Hudson. Except something is wrong with him, too. He?s keeping a secret?even from me.All I know is that everyone?s life hangs in the balance. And it?s my fault?because I still owe the Crone a favor&#8230; and now she?s come to collect.</p>

<p>Summary : The Sixth Order wields the sword of justice and smites the enemies of the Faith and the Realm.?   Vaelin Al Sorna was only a child of ten when his father left him at the iron gate of the Sixth Order. The Brothers of the Sixth Order are devoted to battle, and Vaelin will be trained and hardened to the austere, celibate, and dangerous life of a Warrior of the Faith. He has no family now save the Order.   Vaelin?s father was Battle Lord to King Janus, ruler of the unified realm. Vaelin?s rage at being deprived of his birthright and dropped at the doorstep of the Sixth Order like a foundling knows no bounds. He cherishes the memory of his mother, and what he will come to learn of her at the Order will confound him. His father, too, has motives that Vaelin will come to understand. But one truth overpowers all the rest: Vaelin Al Sorna is destined for a future he has yet to comprehend. A future that will alter not only the realm, but the world.  </p>

<p>Summary : WHERE THERE ARE GODS, THERE ARE ALSO MONSTERS . . .For a thousand years, the Etherworld has known peace.Until now.Many centuries ago, desperate to save her dying sister, Dianna made a deal with Kaden, a monster far worse than any nightmare. Locked in servitude to him, she is forced to hunt down an ancient relic held by her most dangerous enemies: an army led by Samkiel, the World Ender.After the Gods War, Samkiel hid from everything, denying his crown and deserting his people.

<p>Summary : A charming and eye-opening exploration of the special relationship between humans and chickens from Sy Montgomery, ?one of our finest chroniclers of the natural world? (The New York Times). For more than two decades, Sy Montgomery?whose The Soul of an Octopus was a National Book Award finalist?has kept a flock of chickens in her backyard. Each chicken has an individual personality (outgoing or shy, loud or quiet, reckless or cautious) and connects with Sy in her own way. In this short, delightful book, Sy takes us inside the flock and reveals all the things that make chickens such remarkable only hours after leaving the egg, they are able to walk, run, and peck; relationships are important to them and the average chicken can recognize more than one hundred other chickens; they remember the past and anticipate the future; and they communicate specific information through at least twenty-four distinct calls. Visitors to her home are astonished by all this, but for Sy what?s more </p>

<p>Summary : A charming and eye-opening exploration of the special relationship between humans and chickens from Sy Montgomery, ?one of our finest chroniclers of the natural world? (The New York Times). For more than two decades, Sy Montgomery?whose The Soul of an Octopus was a National Book Award finalist?has kept a flock of chickens in her backyard. Each chicken has an individual personality (outgoing or shy, loud or quiet, reckless or cautious) and connects with Sy in her own way. In this short, delightful book, Sy takes us inside the flock and reveals all the things that make chickens such remarkable only hours after leaving the egg, they are able to walk, run, and peck; relationships are important to them and the average chicken can recognize more than one hundred other chickens; they remember the past and anticipate the future; and they communicate specific information through at least twenty-four distinct calls.

<p>Summary : At last, a book that shows you how to build&#8211;&#8220;design&#8221;&#8211;a life you can thrive in, at any age or stage Designers create worlds and solve problems using design thinking. Look around your office or home&#8211;at the tablet or smartphone you may be holding or the chair you are sitting in. Everything in our lives was designed by someone. And every design starts with a problem that a designer or team of designers seeks to solve. In this book, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans show us how design thinking can help us create a life that is both meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of who or where we are, what we do or have done for a living, or how young or old we are. The same design thinking responsible for amazing technology, products, and spaces can be used to &#8220;design and build &#8220;your career and your life, a life of fulfillment and joy, constantly creative and productive, one that always holds the possibility of surprise.</p>

<p>Summary : The remarkable true story of a modern-day Robin Hood: a British college student who started robbing banks as the financial crisis unfolded.Stephen Jackley was a young British college student when the global financial crisis began in 2007. Overwhelmed by the growing indifference towards economic equality, he became obsessed with the idea of taking on the role of Robin Hood. With no prior experience, he resolved to become a bank robber.

<p>Summary : Look-and-find books for young readers, chock full of vibrant illustrations that tell stories without words! Welcome to Wimmelworld?a land of few words, yet endless entertainment! In these one-of-a-kind picture books, every spread is a new panorama teeming with life. Children as young as two will delight in seeking out familiar things?a blue tricycle, a hungry dog, a piggyback ride. And as kids grow up, Wimmelbooks grow with them! The first page of each book introduces a unique cast of characters who are hidden in plain sight on the pages that follow. As older children begin to seek them out, each character?s storyline unfolds right before their eyes: For example, in Animals Around the World, the Puri family goes on an amazing journey to witness wildlife from the jungle to the deep blue sea and beyond! Unlike most look-and-find books, Wimmelbooks are instruction-free, inviting kids to make their own way through the busy Wimmelworld, and to craft their own stories. As kids go from page </p>

<p>Summary : Think Again is a book about the benefit of doubt, and about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong. Evidence has shown that creative geniuses are not attached to one identity, but constantly willing to rethink their stances and that leaders who admit they don&#8217;t know something and seek critical feedback lead more productive and innovative teams.New evidence shows us that as a mindset and a skilllset, rethinking can be taught and Grant explains how to develop the necessary qualities to do it. Section 1 explores why we struggle to think again and how we can learn to do it as individuals, arguing that &#8216;grit&#8217; alone can actually be counterproductive. Section 2 discusses how we can help others think again through learning about &#8216;argument literacy&#8217;. And the final section 3 looks at how schools, businesses and governments fall short in building cultures that encourage rethinking.In the end, learning to rethink may be the secret skill to give you the edge in </p>

<p>Summary : Rumores de que um fantasma espreita as passagens escuras e os por?es da ?pera de Paris, causando estragos, s?o frequentes entre os funcion?rios e artistas. Esse mesmo fantasma tamb?m assombra a imagina??o da bela e talentosa cantora Christine Daa?. Quando a mo?a ? cortejada por um jovem visconde, o misterioso espectro ? consumido pelo ci?me e busca vingan?a. Publicado pela primeira vez em franc?s, em 1909, O Fantasma da ?pera ? uma hist?ria fascinante que, com sua atmosfera de amea?a, oferece uma mistura ?nica de terror g?tico e romance tr?gico que inspirou o cinema, o palco e a literatura desde sua publica??o. E aqui encontra-se integralmente, mais profundo e sombrio que quaisquer das in?meras vers?es dele j? feitas</p>

<p>Summary : Osamu Dazai&#8217;s No Longer Human, this leading postwar Japanese writer&#8217;s second novel, tells the poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. In consequence, he feels himself &#8220;disqualified from being human&#8221; (a literal translation of the Japanese title).Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai&#8217;s first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the author&#8217;s work: &#8220;His world ? suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, ? but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book.&#8221; His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.Cover painting by Noe Nojechowiz, from the collection of John and Barbara Duncan; design by Gertrude Huston</p>

<p>Summary : The 26 characters in this rhythmic, rhyming baby book are a lowercase alphabet with attitude. &#8220;A told b, and b told c, &#8216;I&#8217;ll meet you at the top of the coconut tree'&#8221;&#8211;which probably seemed like a good idea until the other 23 members of the gang decided to follow suit.

<p>Summary : Jeder Mensch sehnt sich danach, angenommen und geliebt zu werden. Im Idealfall entwickeln wir w?hrend unserer Kindheit das n?tige Selbst- und Urvertrauen, das uns als Erwachsene durchs Leben tr?gt. Doch auch die erfahrenen Kr?nkungen pr?gen sich ein und bestimmen unbewusst unser gesamtes Beziehungsleben. Erfolgsautorin Stefanie Stahl hat einen neuen, wirksamen Ansatz zur Arbeit mit dem ?inneren Kind? entwickelt: Wenn wir Freundschaft mit ihm schlie?en, bieten sich erstaunliche M?glichkeiten, Konflikte zu l?sen, Beziehungen gl?cklicher zu gestalten und auf (fast) jedes Problem eine Antwort zu finden.</p>
