<p>Summary : In a realm on the brink of destruction, evil forces snatch innocents to suffer fates worse than death. Only a monster hunter and her monstrous enemy can stop them.Drue Emmerson, noblewoman-turned-ranger, wants one vengeance. With her family slain by the vicious shadow wraiths, she?s determined to defend her fallen kingdom. And that means carving out the hearts of every dark creature she can find.Talemir Starling, celebrated warrior of the realms, has a dangerous he&#8217;s a half-wraith, kin to the creatures wreaking devastation on the world. He?ll do anything to keep his true nature under control? especially around the woman who?s vowed to destroy him.When someone Drue cares about disappears, all signs point to Talemir?s kind. But he?s determined to prove he?s no monster, and to seek answers of his own. Begrudgingly, the pair must join forces to uncover the deadly truth.But in a world of chaos and carnage, where danger lurks at every turn, deadlier still is their attraction to one another </p>

<p>Summary : In un tempo e un luogo non precisati, all&#8217;improvviso l&#8217;intera popolazione perde la vista per un&#8217;inspiegabile epidemia. Chi viene colpito dal male ? come avvolto in una nube lattiginosa. Le reazioni psicologiche sono devastanti, l&#8217;esplosione di terrore e di gratuita violenza inarrestabile, gli effetti della patologia sulla convivenza sociale drammatici. La cecit? cancella ogni piet? e fa precipitare nella barbarie, scatenando un brutale istinto di sopravvivenza. Nella forma di un racconto fantastico, Saramago disegna con maestria, essenzialit? e nettezza la grande metafora di un&#8217;umanit? bestiale e feroce, incapace di vedere e distinguere le cose razionalmente, artefice di abbrutimento, crudelt?, degradazione. Ne risulta un avvincente romanzo di valenza universale sull&#8217;indifferenza e l&#8217;egoismo, il potere e la sopraffazione, la guerra di tutti contro tutti, una dura denuncia del buio della ragione, con uno spiraglio di luce e salvezza che non ne annulla il pessimismo di fondo.</p>

<p>Summary : From bestselling author Susan Casey, an awe-inspiring portrait of the mysterious world beneath the waves, and the men and women who seek to uncover its secretsFor all of human history, the deep ocean has been a source of wonder and terror, an unknown realm that evoked a singular, compelling question: What?s down there? Unable to answer this for centuries, people believed the deep was a sinister realm of fiendish creatures and deadly peril. But now, cutting-edge technologies allow scientists and explorers to dive miles beneath the surface, and we are beginning to understand this strange and exotic underworld: A place of soaring mountains, smoldering volcanoes, and valleys 7,000 feet deeper than Everest is high, where tectonic plates collide and separate, and extraordinary life forms operate under different rules. Far from a dark void, the deep is a vibrant realm that?s home to pink gelatinous predators and shimmering creatures a hundred feet long and ancient animals with glass </p>

<p>Summary : From bestselling author Susan Casey, an awe-inspiring portrait of the mysterious world beneath the waves, and the men and women who seek to uncover its secretsFor all of human history, the deep ocean has been a source of wonder and terror, an unknown realm that evoked a singular, compelling question: What?s down there? Unable to answer this for centuries, people believed the deep was a sinister realm of fiendish creatures and deadly peril.

<p>Summary : Chateau Reawakening is the story of the highs and lows of one couple&#8217;s journey to save an eighteenth century French chateau.When former Australian politician Tim Holding and his fiancee Felicity Selkirk discovered a crumbling French chateau just south of the Loire Valley, they could not have imagined the crazy adventure that would follow.Recklessly committing their life savings and mastering new skills along the way, Tim and Felicity uncover Chateau de Purnon&#8217;s intriguing past while working to safeguard her future. Guided by one of France&#8217;s foremost heritage architects and assisted by bemused locals, this is a story of optimism in the face of sometimes overwhelming odds.Documented through Tim&#8217;s pithy diary entries over two and a half years and accompanied by breathtaking photography, this is both a compelling read and a visually arresting tribute to a truly unique restoration. Chateau Reawakenin g is about daring to dream on the grandest scale.</p>

<p>Summary : MacArthur Genius Grant winner Lynsey Addario?s relentless pursuit of complex truths drive this heart-pounding and inspirational memoir of a photographer?s life Lynsey Addario was just finding her way as a young photographer when September 11 changed the world. One of the few photojournalists with experience in Afghanistan, she gets the call to return and cover the American invasion. She makes a decision she would often find herself making?not to stay home, not to lead a quiet or predictable life, but to set out across the world, face the chaos of crisis, and make a name for herself. Addario finds in photography a way to travel with a purpose, and It?s What I Do is the story of that singular calling?how it shapes and drives her life and how it changes the lives of others. She captures virtually every major theater of war of the twenty-first century and from it creates a historical document of truth on the international conflicts that have made, and remade, our world. She photographs </p>

<p>Summary : In the late 1960s, riding the crest of the counterculture movement, Cea?s family left a comfortable existence in California to live off the land in northern Alberta. But unlike most commune dwellers of the time, the Persons weren?t trying to build a new society?they wanted to escape civilization altogether. Led by Cea?s grandfather Dick, they lived in a canvas Teepee, grew pot, and hunted and gathered to survive.Living out her grandparents? dream with her teenage mother, Michelle, young Cea knew little of the world beyond her forest. She spent her summers playing nude in the meadow and her winters snowshoeing behind the grandfather she idolized. Despite fierce storms, food shortages and the occasional drug-and-sex-infused party for visitors, it was a happy existence. For Michelle, however, there was one crucial element missing: a man. When Cea was five, Michelle took her on the road with a new boyfriend. As the trio set upon a series of ill-fated adventures, Cea began to question </p>

<p>Summary : There was only one woman who could set me free. But I would rather set myself on fire than ask Sloane Walton for anything.Lucian Rollins is a lean, mean vengeance-seeking mogul. On a quest to erase his father?s mark on the family name, he spends every waking minute pulling strings and building an indestructible empire. The more money and power he amasses, the safer he is from threats.Except when it comes to the feisty small-town librarian that keeps him up at night?Sloane Walton is a spitfire determined to carry on her father?s quest for justice. She?ll do that just as soon as she figures out exactly what the man she hates did to?or for?her family. Bonded by an old, dark secret from the past and the dislike they now share for each other, Sloane trusts Lucian about as far as she can throw his designer-suited body.When bickering accidentally turns to foreplay, these two find themselves not quite regretting their steamy one-night stand. Once those flames are fanned, it seems impossible </p>

<p>Summary : An exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of warA?New York Times Book Review Editors? ChoiceIn The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history.?Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists, the ?Bomber Mafia,? asked: What if precision bombing could cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? ??In contrast, the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared even more by averting a planned US invasion.

<p>Summary : History belongs to the heroes. But to get the full story, sometimes you have to ask the side characters.The lives of Leonardo da Vinci, Henry VIII and Queen Victoria fill bookshelves and fascinate scholars all over the world. But little attention is given to the ferret who posed for the renaissance master, the servant who oversaw the Tudor?s toilet time, or the famous horse who thrilled the miserable old monarch.These supporting cast members have been waiting in the wings for too long, and Adrian Bliss thinks it?s high time they join their glory-hogging contemporaries in the spotlight. Fortunately, &#8211; thanks to some recently discovered ancient complaint letters, court transcripts and memoirs in bottles &#8211; now they can.Equal parts fascinating and hilarious, the Greatest Nobodies of History is a surreal love letter to life?s forgotten heroes featuring hitherto undocumented accounts from Ancient Greece to the frontlines of the Great Emu War.All that follows really happened, and some of it </p>

<p>Summary : Wall Street Journal bestselling author Ilsa Madden-Mills delivers a smart and sexy romance about a professional football hottie and the girl he?s sworn to never touch.Homeless and heartbreakingly innocent, Giselle Riley walks into my penthouse and chaos follows.I shouldn?t have invited the girl genius to live with me, but it?s clear she needs my help?not only for a place to lay her pretty blonde head but in finding real love, which she?s not going to get with the crazy men she picks up online.Too bad she?s a twenty-four-year-old virgin and I?m a bad boy wide receiver. She?s off limits for a hardcore player like me?and we?re just friends.Instead, I?m her matchmaking service, no matter how jealous it makes me when I tag along on her dates.I can keep my self-control. Right? No way will I give in to everything inside me that dreams of a girl like her in my world.I may be the best wide receiver in the country, but how could I hold on to a girl like her?</p>

<p>Summary : An intimate portrait of coming of age in a dangerous time and an epic tale of a nation divided.Women can be heroes. When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances ?Frankie? McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over- whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war.

<p>Summary : An intimate portrait of coming of age in a dangerous time and an epic tale of a nation divided.Women can be heroes. When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances ?Frankie? McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over- whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets?and becomes one of?the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle </p>

<p>Summary : Love is at the heart of Christmas?it&#8217;s the reason behind all our gathering and gift-giving at this time of year. In this Advent devotional, Dr Sinclair B Ferguson refreshes our hearts as we reflect on the source it all?love incarnate, Jesus Christ.Over the course of December, this devotional walks through 1 Corinthians 13 phrase-by-phrase, showing us that &#8220;love is&#8221; the Lord Jesus himself.Sinclair Ferguson brings the rich theology of the incarnation to life with his trademark warmth and clarity. Drawing on stories from the Gospels, we&#8217;ll see what ?love? looked like in the life of Christ, and be challenged us to love like him during the Christmas season. Each day&#8217;s reading finishes with carols and hymns for reflection and prayer.However you&#8217;re feeling?weary or frantic, lonely or lovesick?your heart will be refreshed as you wonder again at the truth that love came down at Christmas in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

Una historia que te hablar? sobre el valor ante el fracaso y del triunfo personal que se obtiene tras superar una derrota.</p>

<p>Summary : Time is running out for humanity in The Dark Forest, the stunning sequel to Cixin Liu&#8217;s award-winning and bestselling masterpiece The Three-Body Problem.Earth is still reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion. The aliens&#8217; human collaborators may have been defeated, but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth&#8217;s defense plans are totally exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four people enormous resources to design secret strategies, hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he&#8217;s the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris wants dead. The Dark Forest </p>

Three decades later he wrote A Time of Gifts, the sparklingly original account of the first part of this youthful adventure, which took him through the Low Countries, up the Rhine, through Germany, down the Danube, through Austria and Czechoslovakia, and as far as Hungary.Alone, carrying only a rucksack and with a small allowance of only a pound a week, Fermor had planned to sleep rough &#8211; to live &#8216;like a tramp, a pilgrim, or a wandering scholar&#8217; &#8211; but a chance introduction in Bavaria led to comfortable stays in castles, and provided a glimpse of the old Europe of princes and peasants.Hailed as a </p>

<p>Summary : When Lamya is fourteen, she decides to disappear.It seems easier to ease herself out of sight than to grapple with the difficulty of taking shape in a world that doesn&#8217;t fit. She is a queer teenager growing up in a Muslim household, a South Asian in a Middle Eastern country. But during her Quran class, she reads a passage about Maryam, and suddenly everything shifts: if Maryam was never touched by any man, could Maryam be&#8230; like Lamya?Written with deep intelligence and a fierce humour, Hijab Butch Blues follows Lamya as she travels to the United States, as she comes out, and as she navigates the complexities of the immigration system &#8211; and the queer dating scene. At each step, she turns to her faith to make sense of her life, weaving stories from the Quran together with her own experiences: Musa leading his people to freedom; Allah, who is neither male nor female; and Nuh, who built an ark, just as Lamya is finally able to become the architect of her own story.Raw and unflinching, </p>

<p>Summary : The most complete and penetrating biography of the rock master, whose stature grows every year.Since his death ten years ago, Lou Reed?s living presence has only grown. The great rock-poet presided over the marriage of Brill Building pop and the European avant-garde, and left American culture transfigured. In Lou The King of New York , Will Hermes offers the definitive narrative of Reed?s life and legacy, dramatizing his long, brilliant, and contentious dialogue with fans, critics, fellow artists, and assorted habitu?s of the demimonde. We witness Reed?s complex partnerships with David Bowie, Andy Warhol, John Cale, and Laurie Anderson; track the deadpan wit, street-smart edge, and poetic flights that defined his craft as a singer and songwriter with the Velvet Underground and beyond; and explore the artistic ambition and gift for self-sabotage he took from his mentor Delmore Schwartz.As Hermes follows Reed from Lower East Side cold-water flats to the landmark status he later </p>

<p>Summary : Kaveh Akbar?s Martyr! is a paean to how we spend our lives seeking meaning?in faith, art, ourselves, others?in which a newly sober, orphaned son of Iranian immigrants, guided by the voices of artists, poets, and kings, embarks on a search that leads him to a terminally ill painter living out her final days in the Brooklyn Museum.Cyrus Shams is a young man grappling with an inheritance of violence and loss: his mother?s plane was shot down over the skies of Tehran in a senseless accident; and his father?s life in America was circumscribed by his work killing chickens at a factory farm in the Midwest. Cyrus is a drunk, an addict, and a poet, whose obsession with martyrs leads him to examine the mysteries of his past?toward an uncle who rode through Iranian battlefields dressed as the Angel of death to inspire and comfort the dying, and toward his mother, through a painting discovered in a Brooklyn art gallery that suggests she may not have been who or what she seemed.

<p>Summary : En el contexto de la celebraci?n del VII Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Espa?ola en la ciudad argentina de C?rdoba en marzo de 2019, esta edici?n rinde homenaje a uno de los autores en espa?ol m?s importantes de todos los tiempos y a su obra m?s emblem?tica, que conmocion? el panorama cultural de su tiempo y que no deja de encontrar lectores hasta nuestros d?as.La publicaci?n de Rayuela en 1963 supuso una verdadera revoluci?n en la narrativa en lengua castellana: por primera vez, un escritor llevaba hasta las ?ltimas consecuencias la voluntad de transgredir el orden tradicional de una historia y el lenguaje para contarla. Rebosante de ambici?n literaria y vital, renovadora de las herramientas narrativas, destructora de g?neros y convenciones, Rayuela es Cort?zar en esencia, con toda su complejidad ?tica y est?tica, con su imaginaci?n y su humor.La edici?n recupera, como complemento a la novela, tres textos magistrales de Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez, Adolfo Bioy Casares y Carlos </p>

<p>Summary : Xenia lucha por sacar las mejores notas, impulsada por la ilusi?n de entrar en Medicina, pero ?ltimamente su rendimiento est? bajando. Y es que Xenia se ha enamorado, aunque no de un chico de su entorno, sino de un fantasma, de una voz surgida de Internet con la que comparte su pasi?n por la lectura. Como Xenia es decidida y su amor virtual se niega a una cita, se propone sorprenderlo, de modo que inicia sus averiguaciones con los pocos datos de que dispone.Y todo resulta ser falso, una mentira, ni la foto ni el nombre son reales. ?Qui?n es en realidad su alma gemela? Arrepentida por el abandono de sus estudios confiesa todo a sus padres, segura de haber sido v?ctima de alg?n desaprensivo. Pero pronto un paquete inesperado va a revelarle la identidad del muchacho con el que comparti? sus m?s ?ntimas emociones. Proviene de la c?rcel de menores y contiene la historia de un asesino.</p>

<p>Summary : Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944 to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. Night is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel&#8217;s memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. This new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects important details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel&#8217;s testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must simply never be allowed to happen again.-from the back cover</p>

<p>Summary : ?Si conoces al enemigo y a ti mismo, tu victoria ser? segura; si conoces el Cielo y conoces la Tierra, puedes lograr que tu victoria sea completa?. El arte de la guerra es el m?s reconocido tratado de estrategia militar de todos los tiempos. A pesar de haber sido escrito, presumiblemente, en el siglo V a.C., las ideas estipuladas por Sun Tzu mantienen plena vigencia y actualidad, puesto que los trece cap?tulos que componen la presenta obra transmiten una sabidur?a dif?cilmente superable. Las ense?anzas de este libro son aplicables a todos aquellos ?mbitos de la vida en los que los conflictos y las contradicciones tienen un especial protagonismo, como la pol?tica, la econom?a, la filosof?a, las leyes o la psicolog?a, entre otros, lo que lo convierte en un magn?fico compendio de conocimiento de la naturaleza humana.</p>

In all these forms, one of his favorite subjects over the years?a superb fit for Trillin?s unique combination of reportage and humor ?has been his own professional the American press.In The Lede , Trillin gathers his incisive, often hilarious writing on reporting, reporters, and the media world </p>

<p>Summary : When competing card sharps stir up Siobh?n O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s quiet Irish village, a poker tournament turns into a game of Hangman . . .  Naomi&#8217;s Bistro, managed by the many siblings of the lively O&#8217;Sullivan brood, is the place to go for a cuppa tea in Kilbane. For a pint or a game of darts, it&#8217;s the pub you want. But when Dublin card sharp Eamon Foley is found swinging from the rafters of Rory Mack&#8217;s pub, it&#8217;s time for the garda to take matters into their own hands. Macdara Flannery would lay odds it&#8217;s a simple suicide, but Siobh?n suspects foul play. With conflicting theories abounding, tensions are running high between Siobh?n and Macdara. Soon it&#8217;s up to Siobh?n to call a killer&#8217;s bluff, but if she doesn&#8217;t play her cards right, she may be the next one taken out of the game . . .&#8221;The intricate puzzle and continuing Irish atmosphere make this the series&#8217; best to date.&#8221; &#8211;Kirkus Reviews</p>

<p>Summary : A quarter-century after Frank McCourt?s extraordinary bestseller, Angela?s Ashes, Fintan O?Toole, one of the Anglophone world?s most consummate stylists, continues the narrative of modern Ireland into our own time. O?Toole was born in the year the revolution began. It was 1958, and the Irish government?in despair, because all the young people were leaving?opened the country to foreign investment. So began a decades-long, ongoing experiment with Irish national identity.Weaving his own experiences into this account of Irish social, cultural, and economic change, O?Toole shows how Ireland, in just one lifetime, has gone from a Catholic ?backwater? to an almost totally open society. A sympathetic-yet-exacting observer, O?Toole shrewdly weighs more than sixty years of globalization, delving into the violence of the Troubles and depicting, in biting detail, the astonishing collapse of the once-supreme Irish Catholic Church. The result is a stunning work of memoir and national history that </p>

<p>Summary : Taylor Swift said once, ?The scary news is, you are on your own now. But the cool news is, you are on your own now? The fear of loneliness has been injected into our minds since we were kids. We have learned that the kid who eats, &amp; sits alone, and has no friends is pathetic. In every book/movie, the kid with no friends is always featured as a weak character who needs to be saved. No one wants to be seen as a ?weirdo? hence, our dread of being alone. We don?t want people to think of us as unwanted or not fitting in with the cool kids. We don?t want people to think that no one chose us. So what do we do? We start becoming like an ideal version of whom everyone loves. And in the race to achieve people?s acceptance and love, you lose yourself. But enough is enough. The book is divided into two sections. The first section is about transforming loneliness into solitude. And the second section is about using your solitude to turn it into your growth period. If you are ready to </p>

They included huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates that led to massive printing of money in the world?s three major reserve currencies; big political and social conflicts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in more than 100 years; and the rising of a world power (China) to challenge the existing world power (US) and the existing world order.

<p>Summary : Sometimes broken hearts need whiskey. Sometimes they need music. Other times, only a night with a stranger will soothe the pain. On the night Isaac and I met, we tried all three. When it was over, we went our separate ways. We planned to never see each other again, but I should really know by now that plans don?t work out the way they&#8217;re supposed to. It has been four years since that night, and it?s a bizarre twist of fate that lands me in need of help only Isaac can give. I don?t want to be attracted to him, but I am. I don?t want my heart to skip a beat when it sees him, but it does. And I really don?t want him to look at me that way, but he won?t stop. Because things aren&#8217;t like they were four years ago. And this time? We don?t have the option of parting ways when the sun comes up.</p>

<p>Summary : When, in 1922, thirty-year-old Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, he is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel near the Kremlin. An indomitable man of erudition and wit, Rostov must now live in an attic room as some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history unfold. Unexpectedly, the Count&#8217;s reduced circumstances provide him entry into a world of emotional discovery as he forges friendships with the hotel&#8217;s denizens. But when fate puts the life of a young girl in his hands, he must draw on all his ingenuity to protect the future she deserves. Hailed for its humor, intrigue, and beautifully rendered scenes, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the Count&#8217;s endeavor to become a man of purpose.&#8211;back cover</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;This powerful retelling of Jane Eyre, set in a modern-day law firm, is full of romance and hope as it follows the echoing heartbeats of the classic story. A former foster kid, Jane has led a quiet, solitary life as a waitress in the Toronto suburbs, working hard to get by. Tired of years of barely scraping a living, Jane takes night classes to become a legal assistant, and soon accepts a job offer at a distinguished law firm in Toronto. Everyone at the firm thinks she is destined for failure because her boss is the notoriously difficult Edward Rosen, majority stakeholder at Rosen, Haythe &amp; Thornfield LLP. But, Jane has known far worse trials and refuses to back down when economic freedom is so close at hand. Edward has never been able to keep an assistant-he&#8217;s too loud, too messy, too ill-tempered.

<p>Summary : &#8220;This powerful retelling of Jane Eyre, set in a modern-day law firm, is full of romance and hope as it follows the echoing heartbeats of the classic story. A former foster kid, Jane has led a quiet, solitary life as a waitress in the Toronto suburbs, working hard to get by. Tired of years of barely scraping a living, Jane takes night classes to become a legal assistant, and soon accepts a job offer at a distinguished law firm in Toronto. Everyone at the firm thinks she is destined for failure because her boss is the notoriously difficult Edward Rosen, majority stakeholder at Rosen, Haythe &amp; Thornfield LLP. But, Jane has known far worse trials and refuses to back down when economic freedom is so close at hand. Edward has never been able to keep an assistant-he&#8217;s too loud, too messy, too ill-tempered. But there&#8217;s something about the quietly competent, delightfully sharp-witted Jane that intrigues him. As their orbits overlap, their feelings begin to develop-first comes fondness, </p>

<p>Summary : This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it?for good. Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential. For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.</p>

How can we live our lives when everything seems to fall apart?when we are continually overcome by fear, anxiety, and pain? The answer, Pema Ch?dr?n suggests, might be just the opposite of what you expect. Here, in her most beloved and acclaimed work, Pema shows that moving toward painful situations and becoming intimate with them can open up our hearts in ways we never before imagined. Drawing from traditional Buddhist wisdom, she offers life-changing tools for transforming suffering and negative patterns into habitual ease and boundless joy.</p>

<p>Summary : Pema Ch?dr?n&#8217;s perennially best-selling classic on overcoming life&#8217;s difficulties cuts to the heart of spirituality and personal growth&#8211;now in a newly designed 20th-anniversary edition with a new afterword by Pema&#8211;makes for a perfect gift and addition to one&#8217;s spiritual library. How can we live our lives when everything seems to fall apart?when we are continually overcome by fear, anxiety, and pain? The answer, Pema Ch?dr?n suggests, might be just the opposite of what you expect. Here, in her most beloved and acclaimed work, Pema shows that moving toward painful situations and becoming intimate with them can open up our hearts in ways we never before imagined. Drawing from traditional Buddhist wisdom, she offers life-changing tools for transforming suffering and negative patterns into habitual ease and boundless joy.</p>

Mas, por ser um rato, se recusa a atender animais com um certo apetite por roedores, como gatos ou outros bichos perigosos.Por?m, um dia, apareceu em seu consult?rio um raposo uivando de tanta dor. Como o bondoso dentista podia se recusar a trat?-lo? Por outro lado, como teria certeza de que n?o seria devorado depois que curasse seu feroz paciente? O dr. De Soto ? esperto e descobrir? um jeito.</p>

<p>Summary : Jaxon Riley is exceptional at three things: starting fights on the ice, picking up women post-game, and going home to fulfill his role as the world?s best cat dad. Relationships, unfortunately, missed the list. Lennon Hayes is supposed to be on her honeymoon. Instead, she?s alone and single, vacationing next door to a surly tattooed man who ran his date off the resort. When a run-in at the bar results in a night of bickering and cocktails, she finds herself tumbling into bed with the enemy next door, then sneaking out before the sun comes up. Lennon?s plan to start over in a new city is going great, until she starts her new job. The job? The Vancouver Vipers? new photographer. And the defenseman scowling at her from across the room? The one-night stand she wasn?t supposed to see again. Good thing neither of them are looking for anything serious? Right? Jaxon may not be used to falling, but if he?s going to go, he refuses to go alone. If he falls, he wants Lennon to fall with him.</p>
