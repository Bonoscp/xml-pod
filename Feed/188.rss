<p>Summary : In this stunning novel, Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award?winning author Louise Erdrich tells a story of love, natural forces, spiritual yearnings, and the tragic impact of uncontrollable circumstances on ordinary people?s lives.History is a flood. The mighty red . . .In Argus, North Dakota, a collection of people revolve around a fraught wedding. Gary Geist, a terrified young man set to inherit two farms, is desperate to marry Kismet Poe, an impulsive, lapsed Goth who can&#8217;t read her future but seems to resolve his. Hugo, a gentle red-haired, home-schooled giant, is also in love with Kismet. He?s determined to steal her and is eager to be a home wrecker. Kismet&#8217;s mother, Crystal, hauls sugar beets for Gary&#8217;s family, and on her nightly runs, tunes into the darkness of late-night radio, sees visions of guardian angels, and worries for the future, her daughter?s and her own.Human time, deep time, Red River time, the half-life of herbicides and pesticides, and the elegance of time </p>

Now a talented artist and aspiring filmmaker, Brian, along with Jimmy, Jimmy&#8217;s friend Tina, and Laurie?his reluctant muse?sets off to a remote cabin in the woods with an old 8 millimeter camera to make a true sci-fi horror movie, an homage to Brian&#8217;s favorite movie: Invasion of the Body Snatchers. But as Brian&#8217;s affections for Laurie go seemingly unreciprocated, Brian writes and draws himself into a fantasy where she is the girl of his dreams, his damsel in distress, and his savior wrapped into one. Rife with references to classic sci-fi and horror movies and filled with panels of stunning depictions of nature, film </p>

When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They&#8217;ll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other?s out, and they?ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It?s a bonkers idea? and it just might work. Emma hadn&#8217;t planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka.It&#8217;s supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma&#8217;s toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they&#8217;re suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected?including catching real feelings for each other.

<p>Summary : Frammenti di un Grande Segreto sono stati trovati, lungo il corso dei secoli, nelle tradizioni orali, in letteratura, nelle religioni e nelle filosofie.

Con questo libro imparerete a usare il Segreto in ogni aspetto della vostra vita &#8211; denaro, salute, relazioni, felicit? &#8211; e in ogni vostra interazione col mondo. Comincerete a comprendere il potere nascosto e ancora inutilizzato che si trova dentro di voi, e questa rivelazione colmer? di gioia ogni ambito della vostra esistenza. Il Segreto racchiude la saggezza dei maestri del mondo moderno, uomini e donne che l&#8217;hanno usato per ottenere ricchezza, salute e felicit?. Mettendo in pratica la conoscenza del Segreto essi portano alla luce storie avvincenti che raccontano di malattie sconfitte, ingenti guadagni, del superamento di ostacoli e del conseguimento di obiettivi da molti ritenuti </p>

<p>Summary : A sweeping account of the social and political world of the Roman emperors by ?the world?s most famous classicist? ( Guardian ). In her international bestseller SPQR , Mary Beard told the thousand-year story of ancient Rome. Now she shines her spotlight on the emperors who ruled the Roman empire, from Julius Caesar (assassinated 44 BCE) to Alexander Severus (assassinated 235 CE).Emperor of Rome is not your usual chronological account of Roman rulers, such as the mad Caligula, the monster Nero, the philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Beard asks bigger questions: What power did emperors actually have? Was the Roman palace really so bloodstained? She tracks down the emperor at home, at the races, on his travels, even on his way to heaven. She introduces his wives and lovers, rivals and slaves, court jesters and soldiers?and the ordinary people who pressed begging letters into his hands.Emperor of Rome goes directly to the heart of Roman (and our own) fantasies about what it was to be Roman, </p>

<p>Summary : Para el estrafalario Erik Vogler, mani?tico del orden y la pulcritud, las cosas no pod?an empezar peor aquellas vacaciones de Semana Santa: en lugar del so?ado viaje a Nueva York con su padre, iba a tener que pasar esos d?as con su abuela. Aun as?, ni en su peor pesadilla el obsesivo y temeroso Erik hubiera imaginado que se ver?a involucrado en los asesinatos en serie que estaban conmoviendo a toda Alemania. Con un protagonista aparentemente repelente, la escritora Beatriz Os?s ha iniciado una de las m?s originales sagas de novelas polic?acas de los ?ltimos a?os. Impactante y sorprendente en cada frase. Te atrapa desde el primer cap?tulo en una espiral de tensi?n. Puro thriller. Una vuelta de tuerca a la literatura paranormal combinada con el g?nero negro.</p>

<p>Summary : Para el estrafalario Erik Vogler, mani?tico del orden y la pulcritud, las cosas no pod?an empezar peor aquellas vacaciones de Semana Santa: en lugar del so?ado viaje a Nueva York con su padre, iba a tener que pasar esos d?as con su abuela. Aun as?, ni en su peor pesadilla el obsesivo y temeroso Erik hubiera imaginado que se ver?a involucrado en los asesinatos en serie que estaban conmoviendo a toda Alemania. Con un protagonista aparentemente repelente, la escritora Beatriz Os?s ha iniciado una de las m?s originales sagas de novelas polic?acas de los ?ltimos a?os. Impactante y sorprendente en cada frase. Te atrapa desde el primer cap?tulo en una espiral de tensi?n. Puro thriller. Una vuelta de tuerca a la literatura paranormal combinada con el g?nero negro.</p>

<p>Summary : Rosie Belmont has been driving me wild for years. The good kind of wild. The bad kind of wild. But mostly the kind of wild that comes with wanting your best friend?s little sister and knowing you can?t have her. After living in the city, she comes blasting back into Rose Hill like a storm. Beautiful, messy, and chaotic.And one wide-eyed desperate plea for a job is all it takes for me to hire her.Forbes may have labelled me the  World?s Hottest Billionaire  but all I care about is opening my new recording studio. Something that comes to a screeching halt when I end up face-to-face with a young girl who claims I?m her biological father.Now I spend my days balancing business with parenting a sullen twelve-year-old all while trying desperately to keep my hands the hell off my best friend?s little sister.I vow to keep Rosie at arm?s length. I try to stick to scowls and grumpy one-liners. But with her verbal sparring is merely foreplay?friction that turns to blistering heat.I know damn </p>

<p>Summary : A visual step-by-step guide to writing code in Python.Beginners and experienced programmers can use Python to build and play computer games, from mind-bending brainteasers to crazy action games with explosive sound effects and 3-D graphics.Each chapter in Coding Games in Python shows how to construct a complete working game in simple numbered steps. The book teaches how to use freely available resources, such as PyGame Zero and Blender, to add animations, music, scrolling backgrounds, 3-D scenery, and other pieces of professional wizardry to games. After building a game, instructions show how to adapt it using secret hacks and cheat codes. Instructions are illustrated with zany Minecraft-style pixel art.Master the key concepts that programmers need to write code&#8211;not just in Python, but in all programming languages. Find out what bugs, loops, flags, strings, tuples, toggles, and turtles are. Learn how to plan and design the ultimate game&#8211;and then play it to destruction as you test </p>

<p>Summary : I wanted to lose myself in the small town of Pelion, Maine. To forget everything I had left behind. The sound of rain. The blood. The coldness of a gun against my skin. For six months, each breath has been a reminder that I survived &#8212; and my dad didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m almost safe again. But the moment I meet Archer Hale, my entire world tilts on its axis&#8230; and never rights itself again.Until I trespass into his strange, silent, and isolated world, Archer communicates with no one. Yet in his whiskey-colored eyes, something intangible happens between us. There&#8217;s so much more to him than just his beauty, his presence, or the ways his hands communicate with me. On me. But this town is mired in secrets and betrayals, and Archer is the explosive center of it all.So much passion. And so much hurt. But it&#8217;s only in Archer&#8217;s silence that we might just find what we need to heal&#8230; and live.THIS IS A STANDALONE SIGN OF LOVE NOVEL, INSPIRED BY SAGITTARIUS.Fall in love with this emotional New York Times </p>

<p>Summary : ?Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us. She shows us their strangeness; discerning, sure-footed, challenging our values, piquing our curiosity, she leads us through an alien landscape that moves and delights us.? ?Hilary MantelIn myth, Theseus was the slayer of the child-devouring Minotaur in Crete. What the founder-hero might have been in real life is another question, brilliantly explored in The King Must Die. Drawing on modern scholarship and archaeological findings at Knossos, Mary Renault?s Theseus is an utterly lifelike figure?a king of immense charisma, whose boundless strivings flow from strength and weakness?but also one steered by implacable prophecy.The story follows Theseus?s adventures from Troizen to Eleusis, where the death in the book?s title is to take place, and from Athens to Crete, where he learns to jump bulls and is </p>

<p>Summary : An enthralling novel of secrets, second chances, and confronting the past by the Wall Street Journal bestselling author of When I?m Gone.After a series of devastating losses, Chicago journalist Hannah Williamson has landed in Senatobia, Mississippi, to care for her bedridden grandmother and endure grunt work at a small newspaper. But in cleaning out its archives, Hannah discovers a compelling distraction from her life: a series of rejected articles from the 1930s that illuminate a long-hidden mystery.The articles, penned by a young woman named Evelyn, are haunting accounts of first love, trauma, and surviving a mysterious shooting that left Evelyn paralyzed at the age of fourteen. The articles stir up more questions than answers, and Hannah becomes consumed by what?s left unsaid. Encouraged by Guy Franklin, a local middle school teacher, Hannah?s investigation into Evelyn?s past becomes more personal with each new reveal. For Hannah, as both a journalist and a woman bearing her own </p>

<p>Summary : I?m a full time single dad. A former NFL player turned coach, tasked with turning around a college team full of kids who either don?t take it seriously or are determined to get injured. I will absolutely not be falling for my new neighbor, despite the number of times my meddling brothers try to set us up.Lark Butler is pure chaos wrapped in gorgeous, infuriating sunshine. She showed up out of nowhere??getting paid to cry at a funeral, no less. Who does that? But somewhere between offering her condolences and crawling out of a literal grave site, we?ve found ourselves tangled in the drama of Outtatowner, Michigan?my coastal hometown with a decades-old feud and two aunties determined to end it.I?m finally putting down roots so my daughter has a normal life and I need to forget about Lark. Forget the way it felt the night we kissed or what it?s like to finally take something just for me. But when those sparks ignited, it was more intense than either of us bargained for.Trouble is, I </p>

<p>Summary : In this rom-com about rom-coms, in the spirit of Kasie West and Jenn Bennett, a hopeless romantic teen attempts to secure a happily-ever-after moment with her forever crush, but finds herself reluctantly drawn to the boy next door.Perpetual daydreamer Liz Buxbaum gave her heart to Michael a long time ago. But her cool, aloof forever crush never really saw her before he moved away. Now that he?s back in town, Liz will do whatever it takes to get on his radar &#8211; and maybe snag him as a prom date &#8211; even befriend Wes Bennet.The annoyingly attractive next-door neighbor might seem like a prime candidate for romantic-comedy fantasies, but Wes has only been a pain in Liz?s butt since they were kids. Pranks involving frogs and decapitated lawn gnomes do not a potential boyfriend make. Yet, somehow, Wes and Michael are hitting it off, which means Wes is Liz?s in.But as Liz and Wes scheme to get Liz noticed by Michael so she can have her magical prom moment, she?s shocked to discover that she </p>

<p>Summary : Police officer Isabelle St. John loves her crazy, loud, law-enforcement family. With three brothers and two sisters, she&#8217;s never without someone to hang out with&#8211;or fight with. And she knows they&#8217;ll be there for her when things get tough. Like when her partner is murdered and she barely escapes with her own life.Determined to discover exactly what happened, Izzy&#8217;s investigation sends her headfirst into a criminal organization, possibly with cops on the payroll&#8211;including someone from her own family. With her dead partner&#8217;s handsome homicide detective brother Ryan shadowing her every move, Izzy&#8217;s head is spinning. How can she secure justice for her partner when doing so could mean sending someone she loves to prison? And how will she guard her heart when the man she&#8217;s had a secret crush on for years won&#8217;t leave her side?With her signature fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat action, Lynette Eason invites readers into a captivating new series where justice is a family affair.</p>

<p>Summary : Seven minutes past midnight on March 10, 1945, nearly 300 American B-29s thundered into the skies over Tokyo. Their payloads of incendiaries ignited a firestorm that reached up to 2,800 degrees, liquefying asphalt and vaporizing thousands; sixteen square miles of the city were flattened and more than 100,000 men, women, and children were killed.Black Snow is the story of this devastating operation, orchestrated by Major General Curtis LeMay, who famously remarked: ?If we lose the war, we?ll be tried as war criminals.? James M. Scott reconstructs in granular detail that horrific night, and describes the development of the B-29, the capture of the Marianas for use as airfields, and the change in strategy from high-altitude daylight ?precision? bombing to low-altitude nighttime incendiary bombing. Most importantly, the raid represented a significant moral shift for America, marking the first time commanders deliberately targeted civilians which helped pave the way for the atomic bombing </p>

Filled with behind-the-scenes stories involving everyone from Whitney Houston to Adam Sandler to Monica Lewinsky, many told for the first time here, Hello, Molly! spans Molly&#8217;s time on Saturday Night Live?where she starred alongside Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Cheri Oteri, Tracy </p>

<p>Summary : From the author of the New York Times and international bestseller Unfu*k Yourself, Gary John Bishop presents a no-holds-barred guide to breaking through our cycles of self-sabotage to get what we want out of life.In Unfu*k Yourself, Gary John Bishop told us it was time to stop making excuses?to recognize and take responsibility for the negative self-talk holding us back.In Stop Doing That Sh*t, he builds on that message, teaching us how to stop self-sabotaging behavior. Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way that we?re wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we fu*k ourselves over: We can?t save money. We land in the same type of toxic relationship. We?re stuck in a rut at work. Analyzing why we act the way we do, including what our common grenades are that blow up our lives, Bishop then shows how we can interrupt the cycle and stop self-sabotaging our lives.Written in the same in your face style as Unfu*k Yourself, Stop Doing that </p>

<p>Summary : An eye-opening investigation into the science, economics, history and production of ultra-processed food.It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s the food.We have entered a new &#8216;age of eating&#8217; where most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food, food which is industrially processed and designed and marketed to be addictive. But do we really know what it&#8217;s doing to our bodies?Join Chris in his travels through the world of food science and a UPF diet to discover what&#8217;s really going on. Find out why exercise and willpower can&#8217;t save us, and what UPF is really doing to our bodies, our health, our weight, and the planet (hint: nothing good).For too long we&#8217;ve been told we just need to make different choices, when really we&#8217;re living in a food environment that makes it nigh-on impossible. So this is a book about our rights. The right to know what we eat and what it does to our bodies and the right to good, affordable food.</p>

<p>Summary : For years, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was hailed as a miracle. Study after study showed that HRT, undergone at the onset of menopause, could ease symptoms ranging from hot flashes to memory loss; reduce the risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers; and even extend a woman&#8217;s overall life expectancy. But when a large study by the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative announced results showing an uptick in breast cancer among women taking estrogen replacement, the winds shifted abruptly, and HRT, officially deemed a carcinogen, was abandoned.As it turns out, however, that study was fatally flawed.

<p>Summary : For years, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was hailed as a miracle. Study after study showed that HRT, undergone at the onset of menopause, could ease symptoms ranging from hot flashes to memory loss; reduce the risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers; and even extend a woman&#8217;s overall life expectancy. But when a large study by the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative announced results showing an uptick in breast cancer among women taking estrogen replacement, the winds shifted abruptly, and HRT, officially deemed a carcinogen, was abandoned.As it turns out, however, that study was fatally flawed. Now, fifteen years after HRT was left for dead, Dr. Bluming, a clinical oncologist, and Dr. Tavris, a social psychologist and a leading voice at the intersection of gender and medical bias, track its strange history and present a compelling case for its resurrection.They investigate what led the public &#8212; and much of the medical establishment &#8212; to believe in a flawed study.

<p>Summary : How the Information Age destroys knowledgeWe live in times of increasing inscrutability. Our news feeds are filled with unverified, unverifiable speculation, much of it automatically generated by anonymous software. As a result, we no longer understand what is happening around us. Underlying all of these trends is a single idea: the belief that quantitative data can provide a coherent model of the world, and the efficacy of computable information to provide us with ways of acting within it. Yet the sheer volume of information available to us today reveals less than we hope. Rather, it heralds a new Dark Age: a world of ever-increasing incomprehension.In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle offers us a warning against the future in which the contemporary promise of a new technologically assisted Enlightenment may just deliver its opposite: an age of complex uncertainty, predictive algorithms, surveillance, and the hollowing out of empathy.

<p>As authoritative as it is amusing, this book distills everything Benjamin Dreyer has learned from the hundreds of books he has copyedited, including works by Elizabeth Strout, E. L. Doctorow, and Frank Rich, into a useful guide not just for writers but for everyone who wants to put their best foot forward in writing prose. Dreyer offers lessons on the ins and outs of punctuation and grammar, including how to navigate the words he calls &#8220;the confusables,&#8221; like tricky homophones; the myriad ways to use (and misuse) a comma; and how to recognize&#8211;though not necessarily do away with&#8211;the passive voice. (Hint: If you can plausibly add &#8220;by zombies&#8221; to the end of a sentence, it&#8217;s passive.)

<p>Summary : Based on genealogical breakthroughs and previously unreleased records, this is the first book to explore the inspiring story of the poor Irish refugee couple who escaped famine, created a life together in a city hostile to Irish, immigrants, and Catholics, and launched the Kennedy dynasty in America.Their Irish ancestry was a hallmark of the Kennedys? initial political profile, as JFK leveraged his working-class roots to connect with blue-collar voters. Today, we remember this iconic American family as the vanguard of wealth, power, and style rather than as the descendants of poor immigrants. Here at last, we meet the first American Kennedys, Patrick and Bridget, who arrived as many thousands of others did following the Great Famine?penniless and hungry. Less than a decade after their marriage in Boston, Patrick?s sudden death left Bridget to raise their children single-handedly. Her rise from housemaid to shop owner in the face of rampant poverty and discrimination kept her family </p>

<p>Summary : Heart of Darkness, a novel by Joseph Conrad, was originally a three-part series in Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine in 1899. It is a story within a story, following a character named Charlie Marlow, who recounts his adventure to a group of men onboard an anchored ship. The story told is of his early life as a ferry boat captain. Although his job was to transport ivory downriver, Charlie develops an interest in investing an ivory procurement agent, Kurtz, who is employed by the government. Preceded by his reputation as a brilliant emissary of progress, Kurtz has now established himself as a god among the natives in ?one of the darkest places on earth.? Marlow suspects something else of Kurtz: he has gone mad.A reflection on corruptive European colonialism and a journey into the nightmare psyche of one of the corrupted, Heart of Darkness is considered one of the most influential works ever written.</p>

<p>Summary : The Clave is pleased to announce the newest edition of the Nephilim?s oldest and most famous training manual: the Shadowhunter?s Codex. Since the thirteenth century, the Codex has been the young Shadowhunter?s best friend. When you?re being swarmed by demons it can be easy to forget the finer points of obscure demon languages or the fastest way to stop an attack of Raum demons. With the Codex by your side, you never have to worry.  Now in its twenty-seventh edition, the Codex covers it all: the history and the laws of our world; how to identify, interact with, and if necessary, kill that world?s many colorful denizens; which end of the stele is the end you write with. No more will your attempt to fight off rogue vampires and warlocks be slowed by the need to answer endless questions from your new recruits: What is a Pyxis? Why don?t we use guns? If I can?t see a warlock?s mark, is there a polite way to ask him where it is? Where do we get all our holy water? Geography, History, </p>

<p>Summary : La bellezza e la forza delle immagini fra poche parole. Parole d?oro, proprio come il silenzio.Appartiene a un orso a occhi chiusi la voce di questo libro, una voce che ritorna alla propria infanzia, quando i grandi ? a lui cucciolo in una scatola aperta che lo contiene ? avevano insegnato le parole per avere un posto dove mettere le cose. Ma le parole a volte, pensa l?orsetto con le zampe davanti agli occhi, non sanno dire proprio tutto? La tenerezza di un cucciolo di fronte alla complessit? del mondo. Una storia piena di verit? che nasce dalle immagini e poi diventa parola: rara.</p>

<p>Summary : A powerful and poignant new book by Crazy Rich Asians and Fresh Off the Boat star Constance Wu about family, romance, sex, shame, trauma, and how she found her voice on the stage. Growing up in the friendly suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, Constance Wu was often scolded for having big feelings or strong reactions. ?Good girls don?t make scenes,? people warned her. And while she spent most of her childhood suppressing her bold, emotional nature, she found an early outlet in local community theater?it was the one place where big feelings were okay?were good, even. Acting became her refuge, her touchstone, and eventually her vocation. At eighteen she moved to New York, where she?d spend the next ten years of her life auditioning, waiting tables, and struggling to make rent before her two big breaks: the TV sitcom Fresh Off the Boat and the hit film Crazy Rich Asians. Through raw and relatable essays, Constance shares private memories of childhood, young love and heartbreak, sexual assault </p>

<p>Summary : A powerful and poignant new book by Crazy Rich Asians and Fresh Off the Boat star Constance Wu about family, romance, sex, shame, trauma, and how she found her voice on the stage. Growing up in the friendly suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, Constance Wu was often scolded for having big feelings or strong reactions. ?Good girls don?t make scenes,? people warned her. And while she spent most of her childhood suppressing her bold, emotional nature, she found an early outlet in local community theater?it was the one place where big feelings were okay?were good, even. Acting became her refuge, her touchstone, and eventually her vocation. At eighteen she moved to New York, where she?d spend the next ten years of her life auditioning, waiting tables, and struggling to make rent before her two big breaks: the TV sitcom Fresh Off the Boat and the hit film Crazy Rich Asians. Through raw and relatable essays, Constance shares private memories of childhood, young love and heartbreak, sexual assault </p>

Winters in the Black Forest, when the snow piled up to the eaves and haunches of smoked speck hung from the rafters. Springtime along the Rhine, when the storks came home to nest on rooftops. His parents were born in 1935 and had lived through the Second World War, but those stories, vivid as they were, had strange omissions. His mother was a historian, yet she rarely talked about her father?s relationship to the Nazis, or his role in the war. Then one day a packet of letters arrived from Germany, yellowed with age, and a secret history began to unfold.Karl G?nner was an elementary school teacher and father of four when the war began. In 1940, he was posted to a village in Alsace, in occupied France, and ordered to reeducate its children?to turn them into proper Germans. He was a loyal Nazi when he arrived, but as the war went on his allegiance wavered. According to </p>

He arrived just in time to meet the luminaries of old Hollywood and revel in the friendship of giants like Paul Newman, Mike Nichols, Bob Evans, and Sue Mengers. Over the next forty years, Mamet wrote dozens of scripts, was fired off dozens of movies, and directed eleven himself.In Everywhere an Oink Oink , he revels of the taut and gag-filled professionalism of the film set. He depicts the ever-fickle studios and producers who piece by piece eat the artist alive. And he ponders the art of filmmaking and the genius of those who made our finest movies.

<p>Summary : As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these lenses of knowledge together to show that the awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings are we capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learning to give our own gifts in return.&#8221;Robin Wall Kimmerer writes about the natural world from a place of such abundant passion that one can never quite see the world the same way after having seen it through her eyes. In Braiding Sweetgrass, she takes us on a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise.&#8221;?Elizabeth Gilbert, author </p>

<p>Summary : Barbara Butcher was early in her recovery from alcoholism when she found an unexpected a job at the Medical Examiner?s Office in New York City. The second woman ever hired for the role of Death Investigator in Manhattan, she was the first to last more than three months. The work was gritty, demanding, morbid, and sometimes dangerous?and she loved it. Butcher (yes, that?s her real name, and she has heard all the jokes) spent day in and day out investigating double homicides, gruesome suicides, and most heartbreaking of all, underage rape victims who had also been murdered. In What the Dead Know, she writes with the kind of New York attitude and bravado you might expect from decades in the field, investigating more than 5,500 death scenes, 680 of which were homicides. In the opening chapter, she describes how just from sheer luck of having her arm in a cast, she avoided a boobytrapped suicide. Later in her career, she describes working the nation?s largest mass murder, the attack on </p>

<p>Summary : Poet Laureate Joy Harjo offers a vivid, lyrical, and inspiring call for love and justice in this contemplation of her trailblazing life.In the second memoir from the first Native American to serve as US poet laureate, Joy Harjo invites us to travel along the heartaches, losses, and humble realizations of her ?poet-warrior? road. A musical, kaleidoscopic meditation, Poet Warrior reveals how Harjo came to write poetry of compassion and healing, poetry with the power to unearth the truth and demand justice.Weaving together the voices that shaped her, Harjo listens to stories of ancestors and family, the poetry and music that she first encountered as a child, the teachings of a changing earth, and the poets who paved her way. She explores her grief at the loss of her mother and sheds light on the rituals that nourish her as an artist, mother, wife, and community member. Moving fluidly among prose, song, and poetry, Poet Warrior is a luminous journey of becoming that sings with all the </p>

<p>Summary : Nothing warms a cold heart like true love, and in this newest Black Dagger Brotherhood winter book, a fighter who has never been a savior finds himself falling in love?and trying to rescue?a male who?s lost all hope. With the BDB training center reopening, and the Brothers looking to add more soldiers in the war against the Lessening Society, fan favorite Callum decides to find his purpose in fighting. Apex knows what suffering the male has survived, and he joins the program just to make sure Callum doesn?t get himself killed. As the two hit the streets, and the danger gets real, Callum must decide whether he can open himself up to love or if he will give in to his inner darkness and spiral down into an abyss of hatred and death&#8230; forever.</p>

<p>Summary : In these sixty new poems, Billy Collins mixes the straightforward and the elusive to write about the beauties and ironies of everyday experience. A poem is best, he feels, when it begins in clarity and ends with a whiff of mystery. In Water, Water we learn how vigilance and a respect for the peripheral can result in moments of interest and delight. A cat leans to drink from a swimming pool; a nurse calls a name in a waiting room; an astronaut recites Emily Dickinson from outer space?such common and uncommon events are captured here with equal fascination. In a voice both conversational and melodic, hospitable and lyrical, informal but steadied by form, this poet asks us to tap the brakes and slow down so as to glimpse the elevated in the ordinary, the odd in the familiar.</p>

<p>Summary : In these sixty new poems, Billy Collins mixes the straightforward and the elusive to write about the beauties and ironies of everyday experience.

In Water, Water we learn how vigilance and a respect for the peripheral can result in moments of interest and delight.

<p>Summary : They were an astonishing group: glamorous, gutsy, and irreverent to the bone. As cub reporters in the 1920s, they roamed across a war-ravaged world, sometimes perched atop mules on wooden saddles, sometimes gliding through countries in the splendor of a first-class sleeper car. While empires collapsed and fledgling democracies faltered, they chased deposed empresses, international financiers, and Balkan gun-runners, and then knocked back doubles late into the night.Last Call at the Hotel Imperial is the extraordinary story of John Gunther, H. R. Knickerbocker, Vincent Sheean, and Dorothy Thompson. In those tumultuous years, they landed exclusive interviews with Hitler and Mussolini, Nehru and Gandhi, and helped shape what Americans knew about the world. Alongside these backstage glimpses into the halls of power, they left another equally incredible set of records. Living in the heady afterglow of Freud, they subjected themselves to frank, critical scrutiny and argued about love, war, </p>

<p>Summary : The truth about postwar adoption in America, told through the bittersweet story of one teenager, the son she was forced to relinquish, and their twin searches to find each other. In 1960s America, premarital sex was not uncommon, but birth control was hard to get and abortion was illegal. In 1961, sixteen-year-old Margaret Erle became pregnant. Her unsympathetic family sent her to a maternity home. In the hospital, nurses would not even allow her to hold her own newborn. After she was finally badgered into signing away her rights, her son vanished into an adoption agency&#8217;s hold.Claiming to be acting in the best interests of all, the adoption business was founded on secrecy and lies. American Baby lays out how a lucrative and exploitative industry removed children from their birth mothers and place them with families, fabricating stories about infants&#8217; origins and destinations, then closing the door firmly between the parties forever. They struck shady deals with doctors and </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  From one of our culture&#8217;s most important changemakers, a memoir of breaking barriers. <br />
When Edward Enninful became the first Black editor-in-chief of British Vogue, few in the world of fashion wanted to confront how it failed to represent the world we live in. But Edward, a champion of inclusion throughout his life, rapidly changed that.Now, whether it&#8217;s putting first responders, octogenarians or civil rights activists on the cover of Vogue, or championing designers and photographers of colour, Edward Enninful has cemented his status as one of his world&#8217;s most important changemakers.A Visible Man traces an astonishing journey into one of the world&#8217;s most exclusive industries. Edward candidly shares how as a Black, gay, working-class refugee, he found in fashion not only a home, but the freedom to share with people the world as he saw it. Written with style, grace, and heart, A Visible Man shines a spotlight on the career of one of the greatest creative minds of our times. It is the </p>
