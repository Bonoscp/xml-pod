<p>Summary : For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare &#8211; poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world&#8217;s top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America.In this curse-word-free edition of Can&#8217;t Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.</p>

<p>Summary : Holly Gibney surgiu t?mida e reclusa em Mr. Mercedes e se tornou uma detetive particular talentosa. Neste romance in?dito de Stephen King, ela retorna para enfrentar dois advers?rios perversos.Penny Dahl est? desesperada para encontrar a filha, Bonnie, que sumiu sem deixar vest?gios. Em busca de ajuda profissional, ela liga para a ag?ncia Achados e Perdidos, sob o comando de Holly Gibney. A detetive reluta em aceitar o caso, porque deveria estar de licen?a, mas algo na voz de Penny faz com que Holly n?o consiga ignorar o pedido.A poucos quarteir?es de onde Bonnie foi vista pela ?ltima vez, moram Rodney e Emily Harris. Um casal de acad?micos octogen?rios, dedicados um ao outro, eles simbolizam a banalidade da classe m?dia suburbana. No entanto, no por?o de sua casa bem cuidada e repleta de livros, os dois escondem um segredo terr?vel, que pode estar relacionado ao desaparecimento de Bonnie.Descobrir a verdade se torna uma tarefa quase imposs?vel, e Holly depender? de seus talentos </p>

As the boys&#8217; delicate sense of order fades, so their childish dreams are transformed into something more primitive, and their behaviour starts to take on a murderous, savage significance.</p>

<p>Summary : As remarkable as Columbus and the conquistador expeditions, the history of Portuguese exploration is now almost forgotten. But Portugal&#8217;s navigators cracked the code of the Atlantic winds, launched the expedition of Vasco da Gama to India and beat the Spanish to the spice kingdoms of the East &#8211; then set about creating the first long-range maritime empire. In an astonishing blitz of thirty years, a handful of visionary and utterly ruthless empire builders, with few resources but breathtaking ambition, attempted to seize the Indian Ocean, destroy Islam and take control of world trade. Told with Roger Crowley&#8217;s customary skill and verve, this is narrative history at its most vivid &#8211; an epic tale of navigation, trade and technology, money and religious zealotry, political diplomacy and espionage, sea battles and shipwrecks, endurance, courage and terrifying brutality. Drawing on extensive first-hand accounts, it brings to life the exploits of an extraordinary band of conquerors &#8211; men </p>

<p>Summary : Elspeth Spindle needs more than luck to stay safe in the eerie, mist-locked kingdom of Blunder?she needs a monster. She calls him the Nightmare, an ancient, mercurial spirit trapped in her head. He protects her. He keeps her secrets.But nothing comes for free, especially magic.When Elspeth meets a mysterious highwayman on the forest road, her life takes a drastic turn. Thrust into a world of shadow and deception, she joins a dangerous quest to cure Blunder from the dark magic infecting it. And the highwayman? He just so happens to be the King?s nephew, Captain of the most dangerous men in Blunder?and guilty of high treason.Together they must gather twelve Providence Cards?the keys to the cure. But as the stakes heighten and their undeniable attraction intensifies, Elspeth is forced to face her darkest secret yet: the Nightmare is slowly taking over her mind. And she might not be able to stop him.</p>

<p>    The Vagina Bible</p>
<p>  , Dr. Jen Gunter, Canadian OB/GYN and the internet&#8217;s most fearless advocate for women&#8217;s health, brings us empowerment through knowledge by countering stubborn myths and misunderstandings about menopause with hard facts, real science, fascinating historical perspective, and expert advice. <br />
The only thing predictable about menopause is its unpredictability. Factor in widespread misinformation, a lack of research, and the culture of shame around women&#8217;s bodies, and it&#8217;s no wonder women are unsure what to expect during the menopause transition and beyond.  Menopause is not a disease&#8211;it&#8217;s a planned change, like puberty. And just like puberty, we should be educated on what&#8217;s to come years in advance, rather than the current practice of leaving people on their own with bothersome symptoms and too much conflicting information. Knowing what is happening, why, and what to do about it is both empowering and reassuring. Frank </p>

<p>Summary : A moving, unflinching memoir of hard-won success, struggles with addiction, and a lifelong mission to give back&#8211;from the late iconic actor beloved for his roles in The Wire, Boardwalk Empire,  and Lovecraft CountryWhen Michael K. Williams died on September 6, 2021, he left behind a career as one of the most electrifying actors of his generation. From his star turn as Omar Little in The Wire to Chalky White in Boardwalk Empire to Emmy-nominated roles in HBO&#8217;s The Night Of and Lovecraft Country,  Williams inhabited a slew of indelible roles that he portrayed with a rawness and vulnerability that leapt off the screen. Beyond the nominations and acclaim, Williams played characters who connected, whose humanity couldn&#8217;t be denied, whose stories were too often left out of the main narrative.At the time of his death, Williams had nearly finished a memoir that tells the story of his past while looking to the future, a book that merges his life and his life&#8217;s work.

<p>Summary : This Christmas, wrap yourself in love? ? Facing foreclosure on her California home, widowed Kylie Wayne is grateful to accept her aging aunt Muriel?s offer to come back to small-town Branding Iron, Texas, and help out on the ranch. But when an early storm rolls in, Kylie?s dream of a perfect Christmas for her kids is blown away with the unexpected snow. Comfort and joy seem unlikely, unless a certain long, tall Texan with a bad boy?s charm can rope some holiday cheer? ? No one imagined restless, independent Shane Taggart would work his parents? ranch all these years.

<p>Summary : On the eve of a major treaty conference between Iroquois leaders and European colonists in the distant summer of 1722, two white fur traders attacked an Indigenous hunter and left him for dead near Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Though virtually forgotten today, this act of brutality set into motion a remarkable series of criminal investigations and cross-cultural negotiations that challenged the definition of justice in early America.In Covered with Night, leading historian Nicole Eustace reconstructs the crime and its aftermath, bringing us into the overlapping worlds of white colonists and Indigenous peoples in this formative period. As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms </p>

<p>Summary : A charming, poignant, and mesmerizing memoir in essays from beloved actor and natural-born storyteller Minnie Driver, chronicling the way life works out even when it doesn&#8217;t.In this intimate, beautifully crafted collection, Driver writes with disarming charm and candor about her bohemian upbringing between England and Barbados; her post-university travails and triumphs&#8211;from being the only student in her acting school not taken on by an agent to being discovered at a rave in a muddy field in the English countryside; shooting to fame in one of the most influential films of the 1990s and being nominated for an Academy Award; and finding the true light of her life, her son. She chronicles her unconventional career path, including the time she gave up on acting to sell jeans in Uruguay, her journey as a single parent, and the heartbreaking loss of her mother.Like Lena Dunham in Not That Kind of Girl, Gabrielle Union in We&#8217;re Going to Need More Wine and Patti Smith in Just Kids, Driver </p>

And, for the first time, New York Times television editor Jeremy Egner explores the creation, production, and potent legacy of Ted Lasso.

<p>Summary : The first installment in Neal Stephenson?s three-part Bomb Light cycle, Polostan follows the early life of the enigmatic Dawn Rae Bjornberg. Born in the American West to a clan of cowboy anarchists, Dawn is raised in Leningrad after the Russian Revolution by her Russian father, a party line Leninist who re-christens her Aurora. She spends her early years in Russia but then grows up as a teenager in Montana, before being drawn into gunrunning and revolution in the streets of Washington, D.C., during the depths of the Great Depression. When a surprising revelation about her past puts her in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities, Dawn returns to Russia, where she is groomed as a spy by the organization that later becomes the KGB.</p>

<p>Summary : Autopsies can reveal the secrets of the dead. And this victim is sending Scarpetta a message? Summoned to an unnerving, abandoned theme park to retrieve a body, Dr Kay Scarpetta is devastated to learn that the victim is a man she once loved. While teaching in Rome during the early days of her career, Scarpetta had an intense love affair with Sal Giordano that led to a lifelong friendship.The murder scene is bizarre, with a crop circle of petals around the body, and Giordano?s skin is strangely red. Scarpetta?s niece Lucy believes he was dropped from an unidentified flying craft. Scarpetta knows an autopsy can reveal the dead?s secrets, but she is shocked to find her friend seems to have deliberately left her a clue. As the investigators are torn between suspicions of otherworldly forces, and of Giordano himself, Scarpetta detects an explanation closer to home that, in her mind, is far more evil . . .</p>

Les gens de passage et les habitu?s viennent se r?chauffer dans sa loge o? rires et larmes se m?langent au caf? qu&#8217;elle leur offre. Son quotidien est rythm? par leurs confidences.

<p>Summary : A magical romantic comedy sparkling with spells and witchcraft.To save both her town and the woman who loves her against all odds, a witch haunted by loss must reckon with her turbulent past.Even in a family of chaotic necromancers, Daria &#8216;Dasha&#8217; Avramov has always been an outlier. An event planner at the Arcane Emporium occult megastore, Dasha is also a devil eater: a rare witch with a natural affinity for banishing demons and traversing the veil.Still grieving the loss of her parents and plagued by a dangerous obsession with what lies beyond the other side of the veil, Dasha is both fiery and guarded, an expert at dodging commitment. Her one real regret is a devastating breakup with Ivy Thorn.When they are forced to work together to plan a festival, Dasha hopes that sparks might fly once again. But as they confront the fault lines and passion lingering between them, Dasha and Ivy must also stand against an otherworldly threat unlike anything Thistle Grove has faced before.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Many of the highest traffic sites get more than half of their traffic not through the browser but through the APIs they have created. Salesforce.com (more than 50%) and Twitter (more than 75% fall into this category. Ebay gets more than 8 billion API calls a month. Facebook and Google, have dozens of APIs that enable both free services and e-commerce, get more than 5 billion API calls each day. Other companies like NetFlix have expanded their service of streaming movies over the the web to dozens of devices using API. At peak times, more than 20 percent of all traffic is accounted for by Netflix through its APIs. Companies like Sears and E-Trade are opening up their catalogs and other services to allow developers and entrepreneurs to create new marketing experiences. <br />
   Making an API work to create a new channel is not just a matter of technology. An API must be considered in terms of business strategy, marketing, and operations as well as the technical aspects of programming. </p>

Through skillful leadership, unwavering vision, and seemingly by sheer force of personality, he managed to catapult his realm into the greatest triumphs it has ever he united the political community behind the crown, renewed the justice system, revived England?s maritime dominance. And then </p>

<p>Summary : This book is essentially a teaching machine. The way a teaching machine works is: It asks you a question. If you give the right answer, it goes on to the next question. If you give the wrong answer, it tells you why the answer is wrong and tells you to go back and try again. This is called &#8220;programmed learning&#8221;. The real authors were experts and authorities in the field of programmed learning. Bobby Fischer lent his name to the project. Stuart Margulies is a chess master and also a recognized authority on programmed learning. He is a widely published author of more than 40 books, all in the field of programmed learning, especially in learning how to read. For example, one of his books is &#8220;Critical reading for proficiency 1 : introductory level&#8221;. Donn Mosenfelder is not a known or recognized chess player, but he was the owner of the company that developed and designed this book. He has written more than 25 books, almost all on basic reading, writing and math.</p>

<p>Summary : When a young woman washes ashore on a Fort Lauderdale beach, Sloan McPherson of the Underwater Investigation Unit is called in to consult. Sloan?s instinct says murder, but even then, there are too many questions.For answers she reaches out to Gwen Wylder. The Miami homicide detective is notorious for being manipulative, bitter, a tyrant to her peers, and wicked smart. And she demands something in return from Sloan: fresh insight into seemingly unrelated cold-case murders and disappearances?and a possible serial killer trolling the Florida coast.As loose ends of the old files begin to come together, another woman disappears.

Sloan?s instinct says murder, but even then, there are too many questions.For answers she reaches out to Gwen Wylder. The Miami homicide detective is notorious for being manipulative, bitter, a tyrant to her peers, and wicked smart. And she demands something in return from Sloan: fresh insight into seemingly unrelated cold-case murders and disappearances?and a possible serial killer trolling the Florida coast.As loose ends of the old files begin to come together, another woman disappears. Sloan and Gwen are certain she?s the newest link in a deadly chain. They are determined to track her down before she dies, but they soon find themselves in uncharted waters. And the deeper Sloan and Gwen go, the stranger the case gets.</p>

<p>Summary : Alle wollen alt werden, niemand will alt sein. Der Widerspruch ist absurd, das Leiden daran real. Wie lernen wir, so gut wie m?glich damit zurechtzukommen? Geht das, alt werden und ein erf?lltes Leben f?hren? Elke Heidenreich hat sich mit dem Altwerden besch?ftigt. Herausgekommen ist dabei ein Buch, wie nur sie es schreiben kann. Pers?nlich, ehrlich, doch nie gnadenlos, mit einem Wort: lebensklug. Sie denkt ?ber ihr eigenes Leben nach, und das hei?t vor allem, ?ber ihre Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen. Im Alter tr?gt man die Konsequenzen f?r alles, was man getan hat. Aber mit ihm kommt auch Gelassenheit, und man begreift: ?Das meiste ist vollkommen unwichtig. Man sollte einfach atmen und dankbar sein.?</p>

<p>Summary : There is no doubt about it. Toddlers can be tricky. On one hand they can be lovely. On the other hand they can be really hard work. They&#8217;ll make you laugh. And they will probably bring you to tears. Or at least a high level of frustration.I felt the same way when my children were small and I was struggling to get them to do things. I felt enormous empathy for them, but wasn?t sure what the alternative was to threatening, bribing or putting them into time out.It?s been my mission since then to find another way. I?ve now been working in Montessori education for nearly 15 years and love to learn from the 100 toddlers and parents I see every week in my classroom. I am so happy to share with you what I have learned and help you understand your toddler better too.This book is the result. Your comprehensive guide to raising toddlers in a Montessori way.A quick aside for those of you that don&#8217;t know Montessori. It is an alternative education system where, instead of the teacher standing at </p>

<p>Summary : A #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERFrom America?s favorite government teacher, a heartfelt, inspiring portrait of twelve ordinary Americans whose courage formed the character of our country.In The Small and the Mighty, Sharon McMahon proves that the most remarkable Americans are often ordinary people who didn?t make it into the textbooks.

<p>Summary : In a shabby house, on a shabby street, in the new capital of Madrid, Luzia Cotado uses scraps of magic to get through her days of endless toil as a scullion. But when her scheming mistress discovers the lump of a servant cowering in the kitchen is actually hiding a talent for little miracles, she demands Luzia use those gifts to better the family&#8217;s social position. What begins as simple amusement for the bored nobility takes a perilous turn when Luzia garners the notice of Antonio P?rez, the disgraced secretary to Spain&#8217;s king. Still reeling from the defeat of his armada, the king is desperate for any advantage in the war against England&#8217;s heretic queen?and P?rez will stop at nothing to regain the king&#8217;s favor. Determined to seize this one chance to better her fortunes, Luzia plunges into a world of seers and alchemists, holy men and hucksters, where the line between magic, science, and fraud is never certain. But as her notoriety grows, so does the danger that her Jewish blood will </p>

<p>Summary : When Archie Goodwin?s life is threatened, Wolfe must find the gunman or lose his right-hand man Archie Goodwin is chipper as he strolls home from his weekly poker game, money in his pocket and a smile on his lips. He has just reached Nero Wolfe?s stately brownstone on West Thirty-Fifth Street when a sedan whips around the corner and two gunshots ring out, nearly hitting Goodwin. It is a warning, and the message is The next bullet will not miss. Rotund investigator Nero Wolfe has made more than his fair share of enemies over the years, and it seems one of them has decided to strike, targeting Wolfe?s indefatigable assistant. Some might run for cover, but Archie Goodwin is not the type. With the help of Wolfe?s brainpower, Goodwin will find the man who wants him dead?unless the killer gets to Goodwin first.</p>

I primi tentativi di dare vita a una societ? ordinata hanno successo, ma presto esplodono tensioni latenti ed emergono paure irrazionali e comportamenti asociali: lo scenario paradisiaco dell&#8217;isola tropicale si trasforma in un inferno.</p>

<p>Summary : Siamo stati abituati a ritenere che all&#8217;uomo, in quanto essere dotato di razionalit?, sia sufficiente tenere a freno l&#8217;istinto e l&#8217;emotivit? per essere in grado di valutare in modo obiettivo le situazioni che deve affrontare e di scegliere, tra varie alternative, quella per s? pi? vantaggiosa. Gli studi sul processo decisionale condotti ormai da molti anni dal premio Nobel Daniel Kahneman hanno mostrato quanto illusoria sia questa convinzione e come, in realt?, siamo sempre esposti a condizionamenti &#8211; magari da parte del nostro stesso modo di pensare &#8211; che possono insidiare la capacit? di giudicare e di agire lucidamente. Illustrando gli ultimi risultati della sua ricerca, Kahneman ci guida in un&#8217;esplorazione della mente umana e ci spiega come essa sia caratterizzata da due processi di pensiero ben distinti: uno veloce e intuitivo (sistema 1), e uno pi? lento ma anche pi? logico e riflessivo (sistema 2). Se il primo presiede all&#8217;attivit? cognitiva automatica e involontaria, il </p>

<p>Summary : A warm and uplifting novel about an isolated witch whose opportunity to embrace a quirky new family&#8211;and a new love&#8211;changes the course of her life.As one of the few witches in Britain, Mika Moon knows she has to hide her magic, keep her head down, and stay away from other witches so their powers don&#8217;t mingle and draw attention. And as an orphan who lost her parents at a young age and was raised by strangers, she&#8217;s used to being alone and she follows the rules&#8230;with one exception: an online account, where she posts videos pretending to be a witch. She thinks no one will take it seriously.But someone does. An unexpected message arrives, begging her to travel to the remote and mysterious Nowhere House to teach three young witches how to control their magic. It breaks all of the rules, but Mika goes anyway, and is immediately tangled up in the lives and secrets of not only her three charges, but also an absent archaeologist, a retired actor, two long-suffering caretakers, and&#8230;Jamie. </p>

<p>Summary : The stories in this collection nearly all take place in and around the mountain hollows of West Virginia: a world of cock-fighting, coal-mining, deer-stalking, fox-hunting, truck-driving, prize-fighting, sex, depression, drinking and death. They are the work of an uncannily observant chronicler of his region, who brilliantly evokes a whole crowd of doomed and despairing brawlers, murderers, drunkards and demented husbands and wives &#8211; desperate people desperately alive.Raw-boned and fiercely original, Trilobites &amp; Other Stories is the summation of a writer whose career, though brief, burned with an incandescent flame.</p>

<p>Summary : She can hate me all she wants, but our love is written in the stars?I rarely show my face in the human world, although for her I?ll make an exception. Most mistake me for a handsome, wealthy stranger, and refuse to believe I am the stuff of myth and legend.Not my Celeste. I see the awareness in her eyes, followed by the most delicious fear.Wolf Shifter.However, I?m not just any wolf shifter. I?m a Lunar Lord, and she doesn?t yet know that she?s in the presence of an immortal. Nor is she aware that I?ve waited hundreds of years for her.She still refuses to believe she?s mine. No matter. Her family and her fianc? mean nothing to me. Her contempt and hatred of me even less.Because, whether she likes it or not, Celeste is going to be my Lunar Bride?</p>

<p>Summary : What if Sally discovered Christmas Town?Sally has mostly loved her creepy hometown of Halloween Town. But lately, she can&#8217;t help but want something more. In a place full of the frightening, you&#8217;d think living in the shadows wouldn&#8217;t feel so . . . isolating. She knows she could do so much more if she wasn&#8217;t always stuck in the lab of her creator, Dr. Finkelstein. Soon Sally is surprised to learn that the Pumpkin King, Jack, is longing for a change of his own. Determined to find a solution for them both, Sally follows a vision that could be the key to changing their fates.But the more time Sally spends in the strange, jolly land of Christmas Town, the more suspicious she grows of the seemingly idyllic winter wonderland. What is lurking behind those dancing sugar plums? And what exactly does it mean to be put on the Naughty List? Will Sally be able to save the best of both towns?before it&#8217;s too late?</p>

But when her father dies, she is left in the care of her mother&#8217;s family. Emily is a stranger to the proud Murrays, none of whom think they can cope with such a heartbroken, headstrong girl. They decide to draw lots for her, and Emily is sent to live at New Moon with stern Aunt Elizabeth, the head of the clan. Kind Aunt Laura and friendly, eccentric Cousin Jimmy also live at New Moon, though, so she is not without hope.Emily is enchanted by New Moon, but cannot believe she will ever belong there.

She brings so much life to New Moon, perhaps one </p>

<p>Summary : After a devastating loss, Brynn Wilder escapes to Wharton, a tourist town on Lake Superior, to reset. Checking into a quaint boardinghouse for the summer, she hopes to put her life into perspective. In her fellow lodgers, she finds a friendly company of strangers: the frail Alice, cared for by a married couple with a heartbreaking story of their own; LuAnn, the eccentric and lovable owner of the inn; and Dominic, an unsettlingly handsome man inked from head to toe in mesmerizing tattoos.But in this inviting refuge, where a century of souls has passed, a mystery begins to swirl. Alice knows things about Brynn, about all of them, that she shouldn?t. Bad dreams and night whispers lure Brynn to a shuttered room at the end of the hall, a room still heavy with a recent death. And now she?s become irresistibly drawn to Dominic?even in the shadow of rumors that wherever he goes, suspicious death follows.In this chilling season of love, transformation, and fear, something is calling for </p>

<p>Summary : Fashionable and upbeat high schooler Aya falls head over heels for an employee at a local CD shop. He?s got an air of mystery about him, always dressed well, and has impeccable taste in music. Little does she know?this supposedly male employee is actually her female classmate Mitsuki! Mitsuki generally keeps to herself, but since her seat is right next to Aya?s, she can&#8217;t help but be extremely aware of the other?s crush. Revealing the truth is out of the question?but perhaps getting closer to Aya wouldn?t be so bad&#8230;</p>
