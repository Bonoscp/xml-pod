<p>Summary : Persuasion is Jane Austen&#8217;s last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen&#8217;s brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen&#8217;s previous works, both in the </p>

<p>Summary : A homicide detective in the dark. A serial killer on the loose. Both have their obsessions in a nerve-twisting novel of suspense by New York Times bestselling author Mary Burton.Austin homicide detective Jordan Poe is hunting a serial killer she fears is the same man who assaulted her sister, Avery, two years ago.

But the terrible memories linger, making Jordan more determined than ever to stop this monster in his tracks.Texas Ranger Carter Spencer isn?t one to poach on a detective?s territory. Yet no matter how resentful a capable lone wolf like Jordan is, when she is attacked at a third crime scene and suffers a trauma that leaves her with limited vision, it?s up to Carter to help Jordan navigate a world she no longer recognizes.

<p>Summary : In the midst of a violent student uprising in South Korea, a young boy named Dong-ho is shockingly killed.The story of this tragic episode unfolds in a sequence of interconnected chapters as the victims and the bereaved encounter suppression, denial, and the echoing agony of the massacre. From Dong-ho&#8217;s best friend who meets his own fateful end; to an editor struggling against censorship; to a prisoner and a factory worker, each suffering from traumatic memories; and to Dong-ho&#8217;s own grief-stricken mother; and through their collective heartbreak and acts of hope is the tale of a brutalized people in search of a voice.An award-winning, controversial bestseller, Human Acts is a timeless, pointillist portrait of an historic event with reverberations still being felt today, by turns tracing the harsh reality of oppression and the resounding, extraordinary poetry of humanity.</p>

In that moment, Choso recognizes the evil sorcerer possessing Geto&#8217;s body and is filled with rage! Who is this evil sorcerer, and what relation do they have to Choso? Now that Gojo is imprisoned and the foundations of jujutsu society are crumbling, what will happen to the world as it devolves into destruction and chaos?!</p>

<p>Summary : Built to Last, the defining management study of the &#8217;90s, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning.But what about companies that are not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? Are there those that convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? If so, what are the distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?Over five years, Jim Collins and his research team have analyzed the histories of 28 companies, discovering why some companies make the leap and others don&#8217;t. The findings include: Level 5 Leadership: A surprising style, required for greatness The Hedgehog Concept: Finding your three circles, to transcend the curse of competence A Culture of Discipline: The alchemy of great results Technology Accelerators: How good-to-great companies think </p>

<p>Summary : Uma edi??o de luxo revisada, exclusiva da Amazon, do mais importante livro de fic??o de Umberto Eco. Durante a ?ltima semana de novembro de 1327, em um mosteiro franciscano italiano, paira a suspeita de que os monges estejam cometendo heresias. O frei Guilherme de Baskerville ?, ent?o, enviado para investigar o caso, mas tem sua miss?o interrompida por exc?ntricos assassinatos. A morte, em circunst?ncias ins?litas, de sete monges em sete dias, conduz uma narrativa violenta, que atrai pelo humor, pela crueldade e pela sedu??o er?tica. N?o apenas uma hist?ria de investiga??o criminal, O nome da rosa, sucesso mundial desde sua publica??o original, em 1980, ? tamb?m uma extraordin?ria cr?nica sobre a Idade M?dia. Essa edi??o de luxo, revisada pela consagrada tradutora Ivone Benedetti, cont?m uma atualiza??o da biografia de Umberto Eco, uma nota de revis?o e um gloss?rio com a tradu??o dos termos em latim utilizados pelo autor</p>

<p>Summary : Born to Run is an epic adventure that begins with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets out to find Mexico&#8217;s Tarahumara Indians, the world&#8217;s greatest distance runners, who can go for hundreds of miles without rest while enjoying every minute of it.Running without trainers is now big news, but the Tarahumara have been doing it for centuries and reaping the benefits. McDougall tests the idea by taking us from cutting-edge Harvard science labs to the peaks and valleys where growing numbers of ultra-runners are pushing themselves to the limit. And he finds his own inner ultra-athlete when he pits himself against the tribe, who run virtually barefoot, iin a breath-taking fifty-mile race through Mexico&#8217;s Copper Canyons.A thinking exploration of mankind&#8217;s most ancient pursuit, Born to Run will make you realize that the secret to happiness could be right at your feet.</p>

<p>Summary : Glamour, danger, liberation: in a Mad Men?era of commercial flight, Pan Am World Airways attracted the kind of young woman who wanted out, and wanted up Required to have a college degree, speak two languages, and possess the political savvy of a Foreign Service officer, a jet-age stewardess serving on iconic Pan Am between 1966 and 1975 also had to be between 5?3&#8243; and 5?9&#8243;, between 105 and 140 pounds, and under 26 years of age at the time of hire. Julia Cooke?s intimate storytelling weaves together the real-life stories of a memorable cast of characters, from Lynne Totten, a science major who decided life in a lab was not for her, to Hazel Bowie, one of the relatively few black stewardesses of the era, as they embraced the liberation of their new jet-set life. Cooke brings to life the story of Pan Am stewardesses? role in the Vietnam War, as the airline added runs from Saigon to Hong Kong for planeloads of weary young soldiers straight from the battlefields, who were off for five </p>

<p>Summary : Six murders. One hundred pages. Millions of possible combinations&#8230; but only one is correct. Can you solve Torquemada&#8217;s murder mystery? In 1934, the Observer&#8217;s cryptic crossword compiler, Edward Powys Mathers (aka Torquemada), released a novel that was simultaneously a murder mystery and the most fiendishly difficult literary puzzle ever written. The pages have been printed in an entirely haphazard order, but it is possible &#8211; through logic and intelligent reading &#8211; to sort the pages into the only correct order, revealing six murder victims and their respective murderers. Only two puzzlers have ever solved the mystery of Cain&#8217;s Jawbone: do you have what it takes to join their ranks? Please note: this puzzle is extremely difficult and not for the faint-hearted.</p>

<p>Summary : She?s his sweetest desire&#8230; and his darkest secret.The task was simple. Sneak into Potomac?s most heavily guarded manor. Steal back my pendant. Slip out. Problem number one? America?s most unattainable bachelor caught me. Problem number two? He decided to keep me. As the help. Zachary Sun?s winter may be the coldest I?ve ever felt, but he makes my skin burn. Reserved, calculated, and savagely cruel, he thrives on the weaknesses of others. Little does he know, he just met his match. He may be American royalty. But this peasant will rise to become Queen. Authors? Notes: My Dark Desire is a standalone double-grump romance between a broken billionaire and a feisty maid unafraid to fight back. It is set in the decadent Dark Prince Road world.</p>

<p>Summary : Antes de se converter ao catolicismo Scott Hahn passou a assistir a Santa Missa e ficou maravilhado com o que viu; a B?blia estava diante dos seus olhos; e quando ouviu pela primeira vez o sacerdote pronunciar as palavras da Consagra??o: ?Isto ? o meu corpo&#8230; Este ? o c?lice do meu sangue?, sentiu que todas as suas d?vidas se dissiparam. Sendo conhecedor profundo da B?blia; em especial do Apocalipse, entendeu que a Missa antecipava a festa de n?pcias de Cristo com a Igreja, a Noiva do Cordeiro, que S?o Jo?o descreve no final do livro. Sentiu-se diante do trono do C?u, onde Jesus ? saudado para sempre como o Cordeiro de Deus. ?Vamos ao C?u quando vamos ? Missa&#8230; A Missa ? o C?u na terra?. Dr. Scott Hahn nos ajuda a mergulhar profundamente neste Santo Mist?rio.Prof. Felipe Aquino</p>

<p>Summary : Antes de se converter ao catolicismo Scott Hahn passou a assistir a Santa Missa e ficou maravilhado com o que viu; a B?blia estava diante dos seus olhos; e quando ouviu pela primeira vez o sacerdote pronunciar as palavras da Consagra??o: ?Isto ? o meu corpo&#8230; Este ? o c?lice do meu sangue?, sentiu que todas as suas d?vidas se dissiparam. Sendo conhecedor profundo da B?blia; em especial do Apocalipse, entendeu que a Missa antecipava a festa de n?pcias de Cristo com a Igreja, a Noiva do Cordeiro, que S?o Jo?o descreve no final do livro. Sentiu-se diante do trono do C?u, onde Jesus ? saudado para sempre como o Cordeiro de Deus. ?Vamos ao C?u quando vamos ? Missa&#8230; A Missa ? o C?u na terra?. Dr. Scott Hahn nos ajuda a mergulhar profundamente neste Santo Mist?rio.Prof. Felipe Aquino</p>

<p>Summary : What People Wore When combines the studies of two classic nineteenth-century illustrators Auguste Racinet and Friedrich Hottenroth for the first time. Their works are presented first by chronology and then by subject, so that illustrators, historians, and students alike can choose to follow the path of fashion through the centuries, or study in detail the contrasting styles of individual clothing and accessories. Silhouettes reveal the shape of style through the ages, detailed cross-references draw attention to recurring motifs, and navigation bars help the researcher to travel the complex chronology of costume.With authoritative narrative from leading experts in the history of costume, extraordinary contemporary quotes that reveal the impact of style in its day, detailed annotation, and an extensive glossary, the book provides a magnificent study of the rich vocabulary of style through the ages.</p>

<p>Summary : Our saga began when he came to my rescue. And ended in a night of passion. Thrilling and intense. But as quickly as he appeared&#8230; he vanished. I was certain I&#8217;d never see him again. Until today&#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;d like you to meet our institution&#8217;s most generous benefactor.&#8221; Then a familiar Russian accent takes my breath away, &#8220;Good evening, Nikita.&#8221; My whole body freezes. Apparently my dark prince comes from a powerful Bratva dynasty. And the guy he&#8217;s been wanting to put underground this whole time? My father. Will Leo change his mind when he learns I have a secret of my own? This is Leo Nicolaevich&#8217;s story and a fully standalone romance. Enter the gripping realm of the Nicolaevich Bratva Brothers, where power and passion rule. In this Amazon Top 100 dark romance suspense series, four billionaire brothers dominate both their empire and the hearts of their women. The Nicolaevich and Antonov brothers share the same world.</p>

<p>Summary : A man mourning his alcoholic father faces a paradox: to pay tribute, lay scorn upon, or pour a drink. A wrenching, dazzling, revelatory debut Weaving between the preparations for his father&#8217;s funeral and memories of life on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, Obed Silva chronicles his father&#8217;s lifelong battle with alcoholism and the havoc it wreaked on his family. Silva and his mother had come north across the border to escape his father&#8217;s violent, drunken rages. His father had followed and danced dangerously in and out of the family&#8217;s life until he was arrested and deported back to Mexico, where he drank himself to death, one Carta Blanca at a time, at the age of forty-eight.Told with a wry cynicism, a profane, profound anger, an antic, brutally honest voice, and a hard-won classical frame of reference, Silva channels the heartbreak of mourning while wrestling with the resentment and frustration caused by addiction. The Death of My Father the Pope is a fluid and dynamic </p>

<p>Summary : A man mourning his alcoholic father faces a paradox: to pay tribute, lay scorn upon, or pour a drink. A wrenching, dazzling, revelatory debut Weaving between the preparations for his father&#8217;s funeral and memories of life on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, Obed Silva chronicles his father&#8217;s lifelong battle with alcoholism and the havoc it wreaked on his family. Silva and his mother had come north across the border to escape his father&#8217;s violent, drunken rages. His father had followed and danced dangerously in and out of the family&#8217;s life until he was arrested and deported back to Mexico, where he drank himself to death, one Carta Blanca at a time, at the age of forty-eight.Told with a wry cynicism, a profane, profound anger, an antic, brutally honest voice, and a hard-won classical frame of reference, Silva channels the heartbreak of mourning while wrestling with the resentment and frustration caused by addiction. The Death of My Father the Pope is a fluid and dynamic </p>

<p>Summary : HIS SECRETA Lord takes what he wants. But like anything else, even he can get greedy and betray his oath. That?s where Carnage comes in. A Spade brother runs their prison for those who have wronged their society. It just so happens to be where the Lords have sent me. I VOW. YOU VOW. WE VOW.Most women within the Lords don?t get the chance to prove themselves worthy of the brand or the power that comes with it, but there?s always an exception.I?m one of them.Finally, my time had come to be assigned to a Lord. Not just any Lord but a Spade brother?Haidyn Jamison Reeves.I had everything under control until he found out what I was hiding. Everyone in our world knows the only way to get to the top is to sacrifice something the Lords want. So when Haidyn gave me a choice?become his toy or turn me over to the Lords?the decision was easy. I?ve worked too hard to get this far to allow a man to take what I?ve earned. I chose to become his dirty little secret over admitting I failed. It didn?t </p>

<p>Summary : ?You like it darker? Fine, so do I,? writes Stephen King in the afterword to this magnificent new collection of twelve stories that delve into the darker part of life?both metaphorical and literal. King has, for half a century, been a master of the form, and these stories, about fate, mortality, luck, and the folds in reality where anything can happen, are as rich and riveting as his novels, both weighty in theme and a huge pleasure to read. King writes to feel ?the exhilaration of leaving ordinary day-to-day life behind,? and in You Like It Darker, readers will feel that exhilaration too, again and again. ?Two Talented Bastids? explores the long-hidden secret of how the eponymous gentlemen got their skills. In ?Danny Coughlin?s Bad Dream,? a brief and unprecedented psychic flash upends dozens of lives, Danny?s most catastrophically. In ?Rattlesnakes,? a sequel to Cujo, a grieving widower travels to Florida for respite and instead receives an unexpected inheritance?with major strings </p>

Get off the guilt train, because I know if there was any chance you could have saved me, you would have.I need one thing from you: get out of the army and get to Telluride. My little sister Ella&#8217;s raising the twins alone. She&#8217;s too independent and won&#8217;t accept help easily, but she has lost our grandmother, our parents, and now me. It&#8217;s too much for anyone to endure. It&#8217;s not fair.So if I&#8217;m gone, that means I can&#8217;t be there for Ella. I can&#8217;t help them through this. But you can.

Get off the guilt train, because I know if there was any chance you could have saved me, you would have.I need one thing from you: get out of the army and get to Telluride. My little sister Ella&#8217;s raising the twins alone. She&#8217;s too independent and won&#8217;t accept help easily, but she has lost our grandmother, our parents, and now me. It&#8217;s too much for anyone to endure. It&#8217;s not fair.So if I&#8217;m gone, that means I can&#8217;t be there for Ella. I can&#8217;t help them through this. But you can. So I&#8217;m begging you, as my best friend, go take care of my sister, my family. Please don&#8217;t make her go through it alone.Ryan</p>

<p>Summary : En esta obra exquisita sobre los or?genes del libro, Irene Vallejo recorre la historia del asombroso artefacto que naci? hace cinco milenios, cuando los egipcios descubrieron el potencial de un junco al que llamaron ?papiro?. Con gran sensibilidad y soltura narrativa, la autora se remonta a los campos de batalla de Alejandro, los palacios de Cleopatra, las primeras librer?as y los talleres de copia manuscrita, pero tambi?n visita las hogueras donde ardieron c?dices prohibidos, la biblioteca de Sarajevo y el laberinto subterr?neo de Oxford en el a?o 2000. Los tiempos se funden en la aventura colectiva de quienes solo han concebido la vida en compa??a de la palabra escrita. Y este ensayo acaba prolongando el di?logo infinito del que tan magistralmente nos habla.</p>

<p>Summary : A witty and poignant novel about marriage, middle age, tech-obsessed health culture and the bonds that keep people togetherWhen Jack and Elizabeth meet as college students in the &#8217;90s, the two quickly join forces and hold on tight, each eager to claim a place in Chicago&#8217;s thriving underground art scene with an appreciative kindred spirit.?Fast-forward twenty years to married life, and alongside the challenges of parenting, they encounter cults disguised as mindfulness support groups, polyamorous would-be suitors, Facebook wars, and something called Love Potion Number Nine. For the first time Jack and Elizabeth struggle to recognize one another, and the no-longer-youthful dreamers are forced to face their demons, from unfulfilled career ambitions to painful childhood memories of their own dysfunctional families. In the process Jack and Elizabeth must undertake separate, personal excavations, or risk losing the best thing in their lives: each other.?</p>

Sus ideas han tenido un profundo impacto en campos tan diversos como la econom?a, la medicina o la pol?tica, pero hasta ahora no hab?a reunido la obra de su vida en un libro.En Pensar r?pido, pensar despacio, un ?xito internacional, Kahneman nos ofrece una revolucionaria perspectiva del cerebro y explica los dos sistemas que modelan c?mo pensamos. El sistema 1 es r?pido, intuitivo y emocional, mientras que el sistema 2 es m?s lento, deliberativo y l?gico. Kahneman expone la extraordinaria capacidad (y tambi?n los errores y los sesgos) del pensamiento r?pido, y revela la duradera influencia de las impresiones intuitivas sobre nuestro </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Set against the backdrop of the first all-female Mardi Gras krewe at the turn-of-the-century, the acclaimed author?s mesmerizing historical novel tells of two strangers separated by background but bound by an unexpected secret?and of the strength and courage women draw from and inspire in each other. <br />

Yet rules and restrictions remain, especially for women like Alice Butterworth, whose husband has abruptly disappeared. Desperate to make a living for herself and the child she carries, Alice leaves the bitter cold of Chicago far behind, offering sewing lessons at a New Orleans orphanage. Constance Halstead, a young widow reeling with shock under the threat of her late husband?s gambling debts, has thrown herself into charitable work. Meeting Alice at the orphanage, she offers lodging in exchange for Alice?s help creating a gown for the Leap Year ball of Les Mysterieuses, </p>

<p>Summary : An intimate portrait of coming of age in a dangerous time and an epic tale of a nation divided.Women can be heroes. When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances ?Frankie? McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over- whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets?and becomes one of?the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle </p>

<p>Summary : A queen now in exile as a traitor, Lara has watched Ithicana be conquered by her own father, helpless to do anything to stop the destruction. But when she learns her husband, Aren, has been captured in battle, Lara knows there is only one reason her father is keeping him alive: as bait for his traitorous daughter.And it is bait she fully intends to take.Risking her life to the Tempest Seas, Lara returns to Ithicana with a plan not only to free its king, but for liberating the Bridge Kingdom from her father?s clutches using his own weapons: the sisters whose lives she spared. But not only is the palace inescapable, there are more players in the game than Lara ever realized, enemies and allies switching sides in the fight for crowns, kingdoms, and bridges. But her greatest adversary of all might be the very man she?s trying to free ? the husband she betrayed.With everything she loves in jeopardy, Lara must decide who ? and what ? she is fighting for: her kingdom, her husband, or herself.</p>

A fifth-generation Californian, Sharon Gless knew from a young age that she wanted to be an actress. After some rocky teenage years that included Sharon?s parents? divorce and some minor (and not-so-minor) rebellion, Gless landed a coveted spot as an exclusive contract player for Universal Studios.

<p>Summary : Inventive, hilarious and joyously colorful, this fill-in journal was designed to help kids capture nearly everything that?s uniquely rad about them. With design-savvy, yet completely kid-friendly illustrations, they?re asked to draw or write about a bunch of interesting things ? like what their hair looks like, what their band name would be, what they?d bring to outer space, and how they feel about lightning, lizards and pickles. There may or may not be a place for super-secret stuff inside the book jacket. Whether kids complete their entire compendium on a rainy day, or finish it over a year, it?ll become a treasure to look back on and smile.</p>

<p>Summary : Who and what are supercommunicators? They&#8217;re the people who can steer a conversation to a successful conclusion. They are able to talk about difficult topics without giving offence. They know how to make others feel at ease and share what they think. They&#8217;re brilliant facilitators and decision-guiders. How do they do it?In this groundbreaking book, Charles Duhigg unravels the secrets of the supercommunicators to reveal the art &#8211; and the science &#8211; of successful communication. He unpicks the different types of everyday conversation and pinpoints why some go smoothly while others swiftly fall apart. He reveals the conversational questions and gambits that bring people together. And he shows how even the most tricky of encounters can be turned around. In the process, he shows why a CIA operative was able to win over a reluctant spy, how a member of a jury got his fellow jurors to view an open-and-shut case differently, and what a doctor found they needed to do to engage with a vaccine </p>

<p>Summary : Getting Lost is the diary Annie Ernaux kept during the year and a half she had a secret love affair with a younger married man, a Russian diplomat. Her novel, Simple Passion, was based on this affair, but here her writing is immediate, unfiltered.In these diaries, it is 1989, and Annie is divorced with two grown sons, living outside of Paris, and nearing fifty. Her lover escapes the city to see her there, and Ernaux seems to survive only in expectation of these encounters, saying ?his desire for me is the only thing I can be sure of.? She cannot write; she trudges distractedly through her various other commitments in the world; she awaits his next call; she lives only to feel desire and for the next rendezvous. When he is gone and the desire has faded, she feels that she is a step closer to death.Lauded for her spare prose, Ernaux here removes all artifice, her writing pared down to its most naked and vulnerable. Getting Lost is as strong a book as any she has written, a haunting, </p>

<p>Summary : Poesi ?r livet i koncentrat, menar riksdagens talman Andreas Norl?n. Poesin utforskar det som ber?r oss allra mest: lycka, lidande, k?rlek, l?ngtan, sm?rta och saknad. Poesi utvecklar oss m?nniskor, v?r fantasi och v?rt k?nsloliv.Talmannen har ?ppet visat sin k?rlek till den svenska lyrikskatten. Vid sina tal brukar han ofta recitera olika dikter, som kan f?nga in talets essens eller f?rmedla en k?nsla eller en st?mning p? ett s?tt som g?r rakt in i hj?rtat.H?r har talmannen valt ut 100 favoriter fr?n fem sekler. Det ?r ett h?gst personligt val, d?r en del varit med l?nge och andra ?r s?dana som talmannen nyligen tr?ffat p? och tagit till sig.</p>

<p>Summary : Composto in Cina diversi secoli prima della nascita di Cristo, l&#8217;Arte della guerra ? uno dei pi? antichi trattati di strategia militare; il suo autore ? noto col nome di Sun Tzu, ma si tratta in realt? di pi? filosofi che hanno rielaborato un testo frutto probabilmente di un&#8217;unica mano.Il contenuto di quest&#8217;opera ha influenzato ampiamente nei secoli la filosofia orientale, ma non solo, tanto che essa viene utilizzata nelle scuole di management in tutto il mondo. Perch? Sun Tzu non si limita a dare precetti per sconfiggere i nemici sul campo di battaglia, ma ci insegna a gestire i conflitti in modo profondo e non distruttivo: anche nella nostra vita quotidiana, infatti, la miglior battaglia ? quella che vinciamo senza combattere.</p>

<p>Summary : #1 New York Times bestselling author Linda Lael Miller presents the Stone Creek story that started it all?When trouble strikes in Haven, Arizona, Ranger Sam O&#8217;Ballivan is determined to sort it out. Badge and gun hidden, he arrives posing as the new schoolteacher, and discovers his first task: bringing the ranchers&#8217; children under control. So he starts with a call on Maddie Chancelor, the local postmistress and older sister of a boy in need of discipline.But far from the spinster Sam expects, Maddie turns out to be a graceful woman whose prim and proper demeanor is belied by the fire in her eyes. Working undercover to capture rustlers and train robbers has always kept Sam isolated and his heart firmly in check?until now. But something about the spirited postmistress tempts him to start down a path he swore he&#8217;d never travel?.</p>

<p>Summary : Clare remembers the cold. She remembers abandoned cars and children?s toys littered across the road. She remembers dark shapes in the snow and a terror she can?t explain. And then?nothing.When she wakes, aching and afraid in a stranger?s gothic home, he tells her she was in an accident. He claims he saved her. Clare wants to leave, but a vicious snowstorm has blanketed the world in white, trapping them together, and there?s nothing she can do but wait.At least the stranger seems kind?but Clare doesn?t know if she can trust him. He promised they were alone here, but she sees and hears things that convince her something else is creeping about the surrounding woods, watching. Waiting. Between the claustrophobic storm and the inescapable sense of being hunted, Clare is on edge?and increasingly certain of one thing:Her car crash wasn&#8217;t an accident. Something is waiting for her to step outside the fragile safety of the house&#8230; something monstrous, something unfeeling.Something desperately </p>

Ma quel sogno di benessere e riscatto ? solo sfiorato, perch? prima di diventare uomo il loro nipote lotter? a lungo con la miseria e la violenza domestica: una madre tossicodipendente, patrigni nullafacenti che si susseguono uno dopo l?altro, vicini di casa alcolisti capaci solamente di sopravvivere con i sussidi e lamentarsi del governo, in una regione in cui i tassi di disoccupazione sono sempre pi? alti e l?abbandono scolastico ? alle stelle. Eppure quella che J.D. Vance racconta senza indulgenza ma con un amorevole orgoglio di appartenenza non ? l?eccezione ma ? la storia, in filigrana, di un Paese intero, di quel proletariato bianco degli Stati Uniti che nelle recenti elezioni presidenziali ha espresso la sua frustrazione portando alla vittoria Donald Trump.Elegia americana celebra un?America silenziosa e d? voce a </p>

<p>Summary : A historian of fascism offers a guide for surviving and resisting America?s turn towards authoritarianism.On November 9th, millions of Americans woke up to the impossible: the election of Donald Trump as president. Against all predictions, one of the most-disliked presidential candidates in history had swept the electoral college, elevating a man with open contempt for democratic norms and institutions to the height of power.Timothy Snyder is one of the most celebrated historians of the Holocaust. In his books Bloodlands and Black Earth, he has carefully dissected the events and values that enabled the rise of Hitler and Stalin and the execution of their catastrophic policies. With Twenty Lessons, Snyder draws from the darkest hours of the twentieth century to provide hope for the twenty-first. As he writes, ?Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism and communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience.?Twenty </p>

<p>Summary : Summer in London stops for no-one. Not the half-naked boozers, stoners, and cruisers, the hen parties glugging from bejewelled bottles, the drag queens puffing on hurried fags. It?s June 2019, and everyone has converged on the city?s parks, beer gardens and street corners to revel in the collective joys of being alive.Everyone but Maggie. She?s 30, pregnant and broke. Faced with moving back to the town she fought to escape, she?s wondering if having a baby with boyfriend Ed will be the last spontaneous act of her life. Ed, meanwhile, is trying to run from his past with Maggie?s best friend Phil and harbouring secret dreams of his own.Phil hates his office job and is living for the weekend, while falling for his housemate, Keith. But there?s a problem: Keith has a boyfriend and there might not be room for three people in the relationship. Then there?s Rosaleen, Phil?s mother, who?s tired of feeling like a side character in her own life. She?s just been diagnosed with cancer and is </p>

<p>Summary : Quien mat? a Nola Kellergan es la gran inc?gnita a desvelar en este thriller incomparable cuya experiencia de lectura escapa a cualquier tentativa de descripci?n.

En 2008, Marcus Goldman, un joven escritor, visita a su mentor ?Harry Quebert, autor de una aclamada novela?, y descubre que ?ste tuvo una relaci?n secreta con Nola Kellergan. Poco despu?s, Harry es arrestado y acusado de asesinato, al encontrarse el cad?ver de Nola enterrado en su jard?n. Marfus comienza a investigar y a escribir un libro sobre el caso. Mientras intenta demostrar la inocencia de Harry, una trama de secretos sale a la luz. La verdad solo llega al final de un largo, intincado y apasionante recorrido.</p>

<p>Summary : The true story of Dick Conant, an American folk hero who, over the course of more than twenty years, canoed solo thousands of miles of American rivers&#8211;and then disappeared near the Outer Banks of North Carolina.For decades, Dick Conant paddled the rivers of America, covering the Mississippi, Yellowstone, Ohio, Hudson, as well as innumerable smaller tributaries. These solo excursions were epic feats of planning, perseverance, and physical courage. At the same time, Conant collected people wherever he went, creating a vast network of friends and acquaintances who would forever remember this brilliant and charming man even after a single meeting.Ben McGrath, a staff writer at The New Yorker,  was one of those people. In 2014 he met Conant by chance just north of New York City as Conant paddled down the Hudson, headed for Florida.

<p>Summary : A dazzling collection of eleven interconnected stories from the bestselling, award-winning author of Shrines of Gaiety and Life After Life , with everything that readers love about her novels?the inventiveness, the verbal felicity, the sharp observations on human nature, and the deeply satisfying emotional wallop.In this brilliant volume, nothing is quite as it seems. We meet a queen who makes a bargain she cannot keep; a secretary who watches over the life she has just left; a lost man who bets on a horse that may?or may not?have spoken to him. Everything that readers love about the novels of Kate Atkinson is here?the inventiveness, the verbal felicity, the sharp observations of human nature, and the deeply satisfying emotional wallop.Witty and wise, with subtle connections between the stories, Normal Rules Don?t Apply is a startling and funny feast for the imagination, stories with the depth and bite to create their own fully-formed worlds.</p>
