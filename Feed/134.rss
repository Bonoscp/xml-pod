<p>Summary : Dans un monde futur, les hommes vivent dans de grandes tours, et sortent tr?s peu dehors, sur une terre pollu?e. Au coll?ge, notre jeune narrateur fait la connaissance de C?leste. Atteinte d?une myst?rieuse maladie, elle cesse bient?t de venir en cours. Il va alors tout faire pour d?couvrir son probl?me, et la sauver.Dans son journal, le h?ros raconte r?trospectivement l?histoire de C?leste. Il nous dit d?embl?e se trouver dans un environnement froid et humide, ?tre press? par le temps : un suspense est cr??, parfait ensuite pour la mise en place d?un univers de science-fiction gigantesque et glacial, et pour ?voquer la vie solitaire, m?canique, d?un petit gar?on d?laiss? par sa m?re qui travaille. Dans ces conditions, la jolie C?leste va constituer son rayon de soleil, avant de devenir un myst?re ? elle ne dira pas un mot de tout le roman -, puis une obsession. Il d?couvre qu?elle s?affaiblit, victime symbolique de la pollution de la plan?te : les taches sur son corps repr?sentent </p>

<p>Summary : Runtime: 12 hours and 47 minutesApril 2011: On a remote mountaintop overlooking the remains of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, Azad Ashani witnesses a Quds Force demonstration of a capability meant to upend America?s war in the Middle East. Ashani, director of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security and Irene Kennedy?s former back channel to the Iranian government, recognizes the demonstration?s true significance, and the nation-ending conflict it will provoke. Alone, Ashani stands no chance of preventing this rush to madness.But with the help of one man, he just might.In Washington, DC, CIA director Irene Kennedy briefs the president that the operational window to kill or capture Osama bin Laden at his recently discovered compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan is rapidly closing. But before he?ll authorize a commando raid on Pakistani soil, the president demands irrefutable proof of bin Laden?s presence.Proof he trusts just one man to provide.Preventing a looming war in the </p>

<p>Summary : Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s famous investigations of &#8220;optimal experience&#8221; have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness and greatly improve the quality of our lives.</p>

<p>Summary : Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell.The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon.One night, all the animals at Mr. Jones&#8217; Manor Farm assemble in a barn to hear old Major, a pig, describe a dream he had about a world where all animals live free from the tyranny of their human masters. Old Major dies soon after the meeting, but the animals ? inspired by his philosophy of Animalism ? plot a rebellion against Jones. Two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, prove themselves important figures and planners of this dangerous enterprise. When Jones forgets to feed the animals, the revolution occurs, and Jones and his men are chased off the farm. Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm, and the Seven Commandments of </p>

<p>Summary : A love letter to the cities of the world, from the airline pilot-author of Skyfaring.Ever since he was a boy growing up in Pittsfield, in western Massachusetts, Mark Vanhoenacker has been fascinated by cities: their bright lights, hustle and bustle, and dazzling skylines, and the endless opportunities they offer for personal discovery and reinvention. Now, as an adult, he travels the world as a commercial airline pilot, visiting every city he dreamed about as a child and many, many more. The way he experiences these metropolises&#8211;in 24- to 72-hour layovers, sometimes twice in one week and then not at all for months or even years&#8211;is unlike that of any ordinary traveler, and gives him an utterly unique perspective on what makes a city a city. In this hybrid work of travelogue and memoir, Vanhoenacker celebrates the cities he has come to know over the years, from Pittsburgh to Cape Town, and from Tokyo to Jeddah&#8211;through the lens of his small hometown. In chapters that explore </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  New York Times <br />
 reporter and ?Corner Office? columnist David Gelles reveals legendary GE CEO Jack Welch to be the root of all that?s wrong with capitalism today and offers advice on how we might right those wrongs.In 1981, Jack Welch took over General Electric and quickly rose to fame as the first celebrity CEO. He golfed with presidents, mingled with movie stars, and was idolized for growing GE into the most valuable company in the world. But Welch?s achievements didn?t stem from some greater intelligence or business prowess. Rather, they were the result of a sustained effort to push GE?s stock price ever higher, often at the expense of workers, consumers, and innovation. In this captivating, revelatory book, David Gelles argues that Welch single-handedly ushered in a new, cutthroat era of American capitalism that continues to this day. Gelles chronicles Welch?s campaign to vaporize hundreds of thousands of jobs in a bid to boost profits, eviscerating the country?s manufacturing </p>

<p>Summary : One of Atlas &amp; Boots&#8217; Top 10 Adventure Travel Books of 2021 A dramatic account of the deadly earthquake on Everest&#8211;and a return to reach the summit.On April 25, 2015, Jim Davidson was climbing Mount Everest when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake released avalanches all around him and his team, destroying their only escape route and trapping them at nearly 20,000 feet. It was the largest earthquake in Nepal in eighty-one years and killed about 8,900 people. That day also became the deadliest in the history of Everest, with eighteen people losing their lives on the mountain.After spending two unsettling days stranded on Everest, Davidson&#8217;s team was rescued by helicopter. The experience left him shaken, and despite his thirty-three years of climbing and serving as an expedition leader, he wasn&#8217;t sure that he would ever go back. But in the face of risk and uncertainty, he returned in 2017 and finally achieved his dream of reaching the summit.Suspenseful and engrossing, The Next Everest </p>

<p>Summary : One of Atlas &amp; Boots&#8217; Top 10 Adventure Travel Books of 2021 A dramatic account of the deadly earthquake on Everest&#8211;and a return to reach the summit.On April 25, 2015, Jim Davidson was climbing Mount Everest when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake released avalanches all around him and his team, destroying their only escape route and trapping them at nearly 20,000 feet.

That day also became the deadliest in the history of Everest, with eighteen people losing their lives on the mountain.After spending two unsettling days stranded on Everest, Davidson&#8217;s team was rescued by helicopter. The experience left him shaken, and despite his thirty-three years of climbing and serving as an expedition leader, he wasn&#8217;t sure that he would ever go back. But in the face of risk and uncertainty, he returned in 2017 and finally achieved his dream of reaching the summit.Suspenseful and engrossing, The Next Everest </p>

<p>Summary : Hi, friend! Welcome to the ADHD club.You&#8217;re here because, like me, you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?which, by the way, just might be the worst name for a condition ever?and you&#8217;re trying to figure out how to make your life a little more manageable. Or because, like my wife, Kim, you love, teach, or work with someone who has ADHD, and you&#8217;re trying to figure out how to best support them.The world isn&#8217;t built for ADHDers, and navigating it can wear us down. But we&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret: having ADHD doesn&#8217;t have to be a burden. It can actually be a superpower that propels you to creative heights and allows you to achieve more than you ever thought possible.We want to give you a new perspective on ADHD, whether it&#8217;s your own brain or a friend or family member&#8217;s that you&#8217;re trying to understand. We hope you come away with strategies you can employ to make things a little easier. (We also hope you laugh out loud, at least once or twice.)Most of </p>

<p>Summary : ?The word ?love? is most often defined as a noun, yet? we would all love better if we used it as a verb,? writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness.As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question ?What is love??, her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society?s failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the ?100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.? </p>

<p>Summary : To read Hermann Hesse&#8217;s fairy tales is to enter a fabulous world of dreams and visions, philosophy and passion. This landmark collection contains twenty-two of Hesse&#8217;s finest stories in this genre, most translated into English here for the first time. Full of visionaries and seekers, princesses and wandering poets, his fairy tales speak to the place in our psyche that inspires us with deep spiritual longing; that compels us to leave home, and inevitably to return; and that harbors the greatest joys and most devastating wounds of our heart. Containing all the themes common in Hesse&#8217;s great novels Siddhartha, Steppenwolf, and Demian?and mirroring events in his own life, these exquisite short pieces exhibit the same mystical and romantic impulses that contribute to the haunting brilliance of his major works. Several stories, including &#8220;The Poet,&#8221; &#8220;The Fairy Tale About the Wicker Chair,&#8221; and &#8220;The Painter,&#8221; examine the dilemma of the artist, torn between the drive for perfection and the </p>

<p>Summary : To read Hermann Hesse&#8217;s fairy tales is to enter a fabulous world of dreams and visions, philosophy and passion. This landmark collection contains twenty-two of Hesse&#8217;s finest stories in this genre, most translated into English here for the first time. Full of visionaries and seekers, princesses and wandering poets, his fairy tales speak to the place in our psyche that inspires us with deep spiritual longing; that compels us to leave home, and inevitably to return; and that harbors the greatest joys and most devastating wounds of our heart. Containing all the themes common in Hesse&#8217;s great novels Siddhartha, Steppenwolf, and Demian?and mirroring events in his own life, these exquisite short pieces exhibit the same mystical and romantic impulses that contribute to the haunting brilliance of his major works. Several stories, including &#8220;The Poet,&#8221; &#8220;The Fairy Tale About the Wicker Chair,&#8221; and &#8220;The Painter,&#8221; examine the dilemma of the artist, torn between the drive for perfection and the </p>

<p>Summary : A brilliant and brilliantly different (Kiese Laymon), wrenching and redemptive coming-of-age memoir about the difficulty of growing up in a hazardous home and the glory of finding salvation in geek culture. Stranded within an ever-shifting family&#8217;s desperate but volatile attempts to love, saddled with a mercurial mother mired in crack addiction, and demeaned daily for his perceived weakness, Joseph Earl Thomas grew up feeling he was under constant threat. Roaches fell from the ceiling, colonizing bowls of noodles and cereal boxes. Fists and palms pounded down at school and at home, leaving welts that ached long after they disappeared. An inescapable hunger gnawed at his frequently empty stomach, and requests for food were often met with indifference if not open hostility. Deemed too unlike the other boys to ever gain the acceptance he so desperately desired, he began to escape into fantasy and virtual worlds, wells of happiness in a childhood assailed on all sides. In a series of </p>

<p>Summary : A magisterial epic?an intimate yet sweeping novel with all the luminescence and force of Homegoing; Sing, Unburied, Sing; and The Water Dancer?that chronicles the journey of one American family, from the centuries of the colonial slave trade through the Civil War to our own tumultuous era. The great scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois, once wrote about the Problem of race in America, and what he called ?Double Consciousness,? a sensitivity that every African American possesses in order to survive. Since childhood, Ailey Pearl Garfield has understood Du Bois?s words all too well. Bearing the names of two formidable Black Americans?the revered choreographer Alvin Ailey and her great grandmother Pearl, the descendant of enslaved Georgians and tenant farmers?Ailey carries Du Bois?s Problem on her shoulders.Ailey is reared in the north in the City but spends summers in the small Georgia town of Chicasetta, where her mother?s family has lived since their ancestors arrived from Africa in bondage. </p>

<p>Summary : Sarah J. Maas&#8217;s sexy, richly imagined series continues with the journey of Feyre&#8217;s fiery sister, Nesta.

<p>Summary : From the New Yorker staff writer Hua Hsu, a gripping memoir on friendship, grief, the search for self, and the solace that can be found through art.In the eyes of eighteen-year-old Hua Hsu, the problem with Ken&#8211;with his passion for Dave Matthews, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and his fraternity&#8211;is that he is exactly like everyone else. Ken, whose Japanese American family has been in the United States for generations, is mainstream; for Hua, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, who makes &#8216;zines and haunts Bay Area record shops, Ken represents all that he defines himself in opposition to. The only thing Hua and Ken have in common is that, however they engage with it, American culture doesn&#8217;t seem to have a place for either of them.But despite his first impressions, Hua and Ken become friends, a friendship built on late-night conversations over cigarettes, long drives along the California coast, and the textbook successes and humiliations of everyday college life.

<p>Summary : Now updated with new research ? the book that has changed millions of lives.After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset ? those who believe that abilities are fixed ? are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset ? those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands </p>

<p>Summary : Em 2007, Nosso Senhor e Nossa Senhora come?aram a falar ao cora??o de um sacerdote que necessitava muito da sua intercess?o ? o que tamb?m poderia ser dito de todos n?s em nossa mis?ria espiritual. O sacerdote estava disposto a escrever o que ouvia, primeira e obviamente para seu pr?prio benef?cio, mas em maior escala para o benef?cio de outros que tamb?m seriam tocados por essas palavras e nelas encontrariam luz e for?a.As p?ginas de In Sinu Jesu brilham com uma luminosidade intensa e um fervor que aquece os cora??es, espalhando-se com amplid?o e mergulhando profundamente numa vastid?o de aspectos fundamentais da vida espiritual: o amor rec?proco entre Deus e o homem; a pr?tica da ora??o em todas as suas dimens?es; o poder sem igual da adora??o; a entrega confiante ? provid?ncia divina; a rever?ncia do sil?ncio; a dignidade da ora??o lit?rgica e dos sacramentos; o mist?rio do Santo Sacrif?cio da Missa; a identidade sacerdotal e a fecundidade apost?lica; o papel da Sant?ssima Virgem </p>

<p>Summary : Em 2007, Nosso Senhor e Nossa Senhora come?aram a falar ao cora??o de um sacerdote que necessitava muito da sua intercess?o ? o que tamb?m poderia ser dito de todos n?s em nossa mis?ria espiritual. O sacerdote estava disposto a escrever o que ouvia, primeira e obviamente para seu pr?prio benef?cio, mas em maior escala para o benef?cio de outros que tamb?m seriam tocados por essas palavras e nelas encontrariam luz e for?a.As p?ginas de In Sinu Jesu brilham com uma luminosidade intensa e um fervor que aquece os cora??es, espalhando-se com amplid?o e mergulhando profundamente numa vastid?o de aspectos fundamentais da vida espiritual: o amor rec?proco entre Deus e o homem; a pr?tica da ora??o em todas as suas dimens?es; o poder sem igual da adora??o; a entrega confiante ? provid?ncia divina; a rever?ncia do sil?ncio; a dignidade da ora??o lit?rgica e dos sacramentos; o mist?rio do Santo Sacrif?cio da Missa; a identidade sacerdotal e a fecundidade apost?lica; o papel da Sant?ssima Virgem </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  From the author of Warrior Blue comes an emotional, gritty story about redemption, love, and an antihero with a desperation to achieve his lifelong dream &#8211; to be a good man.Are you ready for redemption? <br />
My name is Soldier, but I was never meant to be a hero.From the moment I was born, I was looked at as a beacon of hope, a guiding light?a savior. But that type of pressure can drive a man to desperation, to do things he shouldn?t, and in my case, that?s exactly what happened.All I ever wanted to be was a good person, someone my grandparents could be proud of, but for a long time, I couldn?t find the strength to be proud of myself.I paid the price.I did my time.Yet &#8230; somehow, I got lucky.I was given a second chance to do better, to be the man I always believed I could be. And after finding the love I never knew I deserved, I?m starting to wonder if there?s still room for me to be a hero after all &#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Lo svezzamento ? il momento che genera pi? angosce nei genitori. Invece ? pi? semplice di quanto crediamo: basta coinvolgere il bambino al momento dei pasti, lasciare che ci osservi, assecondarne i comportamenti. Sar? lui a farci capire di cosa ha bisogno. Un manuale esaustivo, semplice e pratico, propone tanti consigli per organizzare i pasti secondo le esigenze della famiglia e del bambino, a seconda dell?et?. Uno strumento indispensabile per accompagnare il proprio bambino a mangiare bene, per tutta la vita, prevenendo anche i disturbi alimentari. Finalmente niente pesi e misure, niente grammature, niente ansia.</p>

<p>Summary : I pull up at the kerb. I love this park they train in. I must have walked the figure-of-eight around its ovals hundreds of times, at dawn, winter and summer, to throw the ball for Dozer, our red heeler, but he?s buried now, in the backyard, under the crepe myrtle near the chook pen.The boy jumps out with his footy and trots away, bouncing it. Boy? Look at him. He?s five foot eleven. The last of my three grandkids. This year he?s in the Under 16s.It?s footy season in Melbourne, and Helen Garner is following her grandson?s suburban team. She turns up not only at every game (give or take), but at every training session, shivering on the sidelines in the dark, fascinated by the spectacle.She?s a passionate Western Bulldogs supporter (with a rather shaky grasp of the rules) and a great admirer of the players and the epic theatre of the game. But this is something more than that. It is a chance to connect with her youngest grandchild, to be close to him in his last moments as a child and </p>

<p>Summary : Born to an American myth and raised in the wilds of Graceland, Lisa Marie Presley tells her whole story for the first time in this raw, riveting, one-of-a-kind memoir faithfully completed by her daughter, Riley Keough. In 2022, Lisa Marie Presley asked her daughter to help finally finish her long-gestating memoir.A month later, Lisa Marie was dead, and the world would never know her story in her own words, never know the passionate, joyful, caring, and complicated woman that Riley loved and grieved. Riley got the tapes that her mother had recorded for the book, laid in her bed, and listened as Lisa Marie told story after story about smashing golf carts together in the yards of Graceland, about the unconditional love she felt from her father, about being upstairs, just the two of them. About getting dragged screaming out of the bathroom as she ran towards his body on the floor. About living in Los Angeles with her mother, getting sent to school after school, always kicked out, always </p>

<p>Summary : An expert diagnosis of U.S. foreign policy?why it keeps disappointing us, and what we can do to fix itIn 1992, the United States stood at the pinnacle of world power and Americans were confident that a new era of peace and prosperity was at hand. Twenty-five years later, those hopes have been dashed. Relations with Russia and China have deteriorated, the European Union is wobbling, and violent extremism is spreading.The reason for these recurring failures, Stephen M. Walt argues in The Hell of Good Intentions, is the combination of America?s still-unmatched power and the foreign policy establishment?s stubborn consensus around a strategy of ?liberal hegemony.? Because the United States is so powerful and secure, it can pursue ambitious foreign policy goals even when they are unnecessary and doomed to fail.

There were ostensibly more interesting people on the flight (the bride and groom, the jittery, possibly famous woman, the giant Hemsworth-esque guy who looks like an off-duty superhero, the frazzled, gorgeous flight attendant) but none would become as famous as ?The Death Lady.?

<p>Summary : Like the one-time bestseller Jonathan Livingston Seagull, The Alchemist presents a simple fable, based on simple truths and places it in a highly unique situation. And though we may sniff a bestselling formula, it is certainly not a new one: even the ancient tribal storytellers knew that this is the most successful method of entertaining an audience while slipping in a lesson or two. Brazilian storyteller Paulo Coehlo introduces Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. And so he&#8217;s off: leaving Spain to literally follow his dream.  Along the way he meets many spiritual messengers, who come in unassuming forms such as a camel driver and a well-read Englishman. In one of the Englishman&#8217;s books, Santiago first learns about the alchemists&#8211;men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the &#8220;Soul of the World.&#8221; Of course he does </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;A powerful and penetrating exploration of what separates great companies and great leaders from the rest.&#8221; -Polly LaBarre, coauthor of Mavericks at Work  Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty? In studying the leaders who&#8217;ve had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way-and it&#8217;s the complete opposite of what everyone else does. People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright brothers might have little in common, but they all started with why. Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire.</p>

<p>Summary : Once upon a time there was a tiny kingdom called Cornucopia, as rich in happiness as it was in gold, and famous for its food. From the delicate cream cheeses of Kurdsburg to the Hopes-of-Heaven pastries of Chouxville, each was so delicious that people wept with joy as they ate them.But even in this happy kingdom, a monster lurks. Legend tells of a fearsome creature living far to the north in the Marshlands&#8230; the Ickabog. Some say it breathes fire, spits poison, and roars through the mist as it carries off wayward sheep and children alike.

<p>Summary : Once upon a time there was a tiny kingdom called Cornucopia, as rich in happiness as it was in gold, and famous for its food. From the delicate cream cheeses of Kurdsburg to the Hopes-of-Heaven pastries of Chouxville, each was so delicious that people wept with joy as they ate them.But even in this happy kingdom, a monster lurks. Legend tells of a fearsome creature living far to the north in the Marshlands&#8230; the Ickabog. Some say it breathes fire, spits poison, and roars through the mist as it carries off wayward sheep and children alike. Some say it&#8217;s just a myth&#8230;And when that myth takes on a life of its own, casting a shadow over the kingdom, two children ? best friends Bert and Daisy ? embark on a great adventure to untangle the truth and find out where the real monster lies, bringing hope and happiness to Cornucopia once more.Features full-colour illustrations by the young winners of The Ickabog competition.</p>

<p>Summary : Described by The Times on its first publication in 1865 as &#8216;an excellent piece of nonsense&#8217;, Lewis Carroll&#8217;s Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland has gone on to become one of the most popular books ever written, loved by children and adults alike and translated into over 125 languages.In Tove Jansson, Carroll&#8217;s classic finds an illustrator worthy of its enchantment and surreal beauty. Jansson is renowned worldwide for her hugely successful books about the inhabitants of Moomin Valley. What is less well known is that she also devoted her unique gifts to illustrating Alice&#8217;s extraordinary adventures.Over forty years after her interpretation of Lewis Carroll&#8217;s masterpiece was first enjoyed by Scandinavian readers, Tove Jansson&#8217;s beautifully realised edition of the original text of Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland is finally made available to an English-speaking audience.</p>

<p>Summary : Following the death of her closest friend, Sloane Crosley explores multiple kinds of loss in this disarmingly witty and poignant memoir.Grief Is for People is a deeply moving and surprisingly suspenseful portrait of friendship and a book about loss packed with verve for life. Sloane Crosley is one of our most renowned observers of contemporary behavior, and now the pathos that has been ever present in her trademark wit is on full display.

This book delves deeply into its context, beliefs, and origins in Europe?s history.The witch came to prominence?and often a painful death?in early modern Europe, yet her origins are much more geographically diverse and historically deep.

What&#8217;s my past?&#8217; A girl and her mother are on the lam. They&#8217;ve been running for sixteen years, from police and the monster they left in the kitchen with the knife in his throat.

<p>Summary : Raised by a family of survivalists, FBI agent Mercy Kilpatrick can take on any challenge?even the hostile reception to her homecoming. But she?s not the only one causing chaos in the rural community of Eagle?s Nest, Oregon. At first believed to be teenage pranks, a series of fires takes a deadly turn with the murder of two sheriff?s deputies. Now, along with Police Chief Truman Daly, Mercy is on the hunt for an arsonist turned killer.Still shunned by her family and members of the community, Mercy must keep her ear close to the ground to pick up any leads. And it?s not long before she hears rumors of the area?s growing antigovernment militia movement. If the arsonist is among their ranks, Mercy is determined to smoke the culprit out. But when her investigation uncovers a shocking secret, will this hunt for a madman turn into her own trial by fire?</p>

<p>Summary : Lenny Marks is excellent at not having a life.She bikes home from work at exactly 4pm each day, buys the same groceries for the same meals every week, and owns thirty-six copies of The Hobbit (currently arranged by height). The closest thing she has to a friendship is playing Scrabble against an imaginary Monica Gellar while watching Friends reruns.And Lenny Marks is very, very good at not remembering what happened the day her mother and stepfather disappeared when she was still a child. The day a voice in the back of her mind started whispering, You did this.Until a letter from the parole board arrives in the mail?and when her desperate attempts to ignore it fail, Lenny starts to unravel. As long-buried memories come to the surface, Lenny?s careful routines fall apart. For the first time, she finds herself forced to connect with the community around her, and unexpected new relationships begin to bloom. Lenny Marks may finally get a life?but what if her past catches up to her </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  There?s something out there:</p>
<p>  a juggernaut of evil bearing down to crush the Republic?,</p>
<p>  unless one lone Jedi, shunned and reviled, can stop it. <br />
Revan: hero, traitor, conqueror, villain, savior. A Jedi who left Coruscant to defeat Mandalorians and returned a disciple of the dark side, bent on destroying the Republic. The Jedi Council gave Revan his life back, but the price of redemption was high. His memories have been erased. All that?s left are nightmares and deep, abiding fear.What exactly happened beyond the Outer Rim? Revan can?t quite remember, yet can?t entirely forget. Somehow he stumbled across a terrible secret that threatens the very existence of the Republic. With no idea what it is, or how to stop it, Revan may very well fail, for he?s never faced a more powerful and diabolic enemy. But only death can stop him from trying.</p>

<p>Summary : The post-apocalyptic world isn?t that bad. Sure, there are mutants. But, for the people of New Hope, daily life isn?t so much a struggle of finding food or medicine as it is trying to find a new shortstop for their kickball team. This makes it difficult for a post-apocalyptic warrior to find work. Thankfully, an army full of killers is making its way to the peaceful town and plans to raze it to the ground. Only a fully trained post-apocalyptic-nomadic warrior can stop them. Two have offered their services. One is invited to help. The other is sent to roam the wasteland. Did the townspeople make the right decision? Will they be saved? Did they find a shortstop? What?s with all the bears? Find out in Post-Apocalyptic Nomadic Warriors, a fast-paced action and adventure novel set in a horrific future that doesn?t take itself too seriously.</p>

<p>Summary : The fourth book in the stormlight Archive series, Rhythm of War, marks the eagerly awaited sequel to the #1 New York Times bestselling Oathbringer, from epic fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson.After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war.

<p>Summary : A remarkable debut in the vein of&#8221; Before I Go to Sleep&#8221; and already an international sensation &#8220;Disclaimer &#8220;is a brilliantly conceived, deeply unsettling psychological thriller about a woman haunted by secrets, the consuming desire for revenge, and the terrible price we pay when we try to hide the truth.Finding a mysterious novel at her bedside plunges documentary filmmaker Catherine Ravenscroft into a living nightmare. Though ostensibly fiction, &#8220;The Perfect Stranger &#8220;recreates in vivid, unmistakable detail the terrible day she became hostage to a dark secret, a secret that only one other person knew and that person is dead.Now that the past is catching up with her, Catherine s world is falling apart. Her only hope is to confront what really happened on that awful day even if the shocking truth might destroy her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : As he continues showing me their incredible penthouse apartment, I have a terrible feeling about the woman behind closed doors. But I can&#8217;t risk losing this job ? not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe . . .It&#8217;s hard to find an employer who doesn&#8217;t ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It&#8217;s almost perfect. But I still haven&#8217;t met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I&#8217;m sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I&#8217;m doing laundry. And one day I can&#8217;t help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything&#8230;That&#8217;s when I make a promise. After all, I&#8217;ve done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up </p>
