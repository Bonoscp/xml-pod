<p>Summary : A raw, compelling memoir of baseball, family, fame, addiction, and recovery, by one of the most beloved baseball players of his generation.How does it feel to be born with enormous gifts, in a life shadowed by tragedy? What does it mean when the gift that opens the world for us is not enough to stop us from losing the things we love? And what new gifts do we find in that loss? Baseball had been CC Sabathia?s life since he was a kid in gritty, baseball-obsessed Vallejo, California. He was a star by the time he was a preteen and a professional athlete when he was still a teenager. Everything he knew about how to be a person?an adult, a husband and father, a leader?he learned in rhythm with the baseball season, the every-fifth-day high-intensity spotlight of a starting pitcher, all while dealing with one of the sport?s most turbulent eras: racism in a sport with diminishing black presence; the era of performance-enhancing drugs; and the increasing tension between high-value contracts </p>

<p>Summary : Leigh Brackon is back home to look after her ?ailing? mother. But she suspects maternal meddling when she finds her old flame John McElroy knee-deep in landscaping in her mum&#8217;s backyard.

<p>Summary : For the last 100,000 years, we Sapiens have accumulated enormous power. But despite all our discoveries, inventions and conquests, we now find ourselves in an existential crisis. The world is on the verge of ecological collapse. Misinformation abounds. And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI ? a new information network that threatens to annihilate us.

<p>Summary : A boy living on Mars unexpectedly becomes a dragon rider in this first book in the sci-fi and fantasy mash-up The Dragonships series, sure to delight fans of Skandar and Eragon.Keep your eyes down and your feet moving, or this planet will rust you. That?s what Lunar Jones tells the other kids at the relocation clinic. All of them were born on Mars, a planet that never wanted people in the first place. With resources scarce and hope even scarcer, it?s easy to get distracted looking up. After all, their ancestors descended from the stars. Martian history always starts with Earth. The first astronauts discovered that space was already occupied. Not by little green men or flying saucers. It was full of dragons. One for every moon, every planet, every star. When humanity discovered that Earth?s dragon had sacrificed herself to make their home planet habitable, they set their sights on Mars. If one dead dragon could breathe life into a world, why not create another one? Mankind won the war </p>

<p>Summary : Eintauchen in die magischen Welten der Disney-PrinzessinnenDas gro?e goldene Buch der Prinzessinnen enth?lt zehn verschiedene Geschichten und M?rchen zum Vorlesen, alle in idealer Einschlafl?nge. In jeder der Erz?hlungen nimmt eine andere Disney-Prinzessin die Leserinnen und Leser mit in ihre ganz eigene zauberhafte Welt: Mit Arielle erleben die Kinder farbenfrohe Meeresabenteuer, in ?K?ss den Frosch? entf?hrt Heldin Tiana sie in die verwunschenen S?mpfe von New Orleans, und an der Seite von Merida geht es in die Berglandschaften der schottischen Highlands. Doch nat?rlich sind auch klassische M?rchenprinzessinnen wie Aschenputtel, Dornr?schen und Rapunzel mit von der Partie!</p>

<p>Summary : Magic has made the city of Tiran an industrial utopia, but magic has a cost?and the collectors have come calling.An orphan since the age of four, Sciona has always had more to prove than her fellow students. For twenty years, she has devoted every waking moment to the study of magic, fueled by a mad desire to achieve the impossible: to be the first woman ever admitted to the High Magistry. When she finally claws her way up the ranks to become a highmage, however, she finds that her challenges have just begun. Her new colleagues will stop at nothing to let her know she is unwelcome, beginning with giving her a janitor instead of a qualified lab assistant.What neither Sciona nor her peers realize is that her taciturn assistant was once more than a janitor; before he mopped floors for the mages, Thomil was a nomadic hunter from beyond Tiran?s magical barrier. Ten years have passed since he survived the perilous crossing that killed his family. But working for a highmage, he sees the </p>

<p>Summary : One of the most prominent voices of her generation debuts with an extraordinarily powerful memoir: the story of a childhood defined by the ever looming absence of her incarcerated father and the path we must take to both honor and overcome our origins. For as long as she could remember, Ashley has put her father on a pedestal. Despite having only vague memories of seeing him face-to-face, she believes he&#8217;s the only person in the entire world who understands her. She thinks she understands him too. He&#8217;s sensitive like her, an artist, and maybe even just as afraid of the dark. She&#8217;s certain that one day they&#8217;ll be reunited again, and she&#8217;ll finally feel complete. There are just a few problems: he&#8217;s in prison, and she doesn&#8217;t know what he did to end up there.Through poverty, puberty, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley returns to her image of her father for hope and encouragement. She doesn&#8217;t know how to deal with the incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to </p>

<p>Summary : It?s winter, and a new kind of predator has just come out of hibernation.All summer long he has been hibernating, just like the bears do in winter. During the fall he spent his months preparing, getting ready, making sure this season would be his best ever. And when winter finally comes?he?ll hunt.The winters in Willow Falls, Iowa are cold, brutal and unforgiving. And so is the town?s newest visitor. Except he?s not passing through. He?s here on vacation, for some fun and he?s going to stay for a while.They call him ?Robin Hood?, a winter serial killer who has left a gruesome trail of horror and death across four Midwestern states. His grisly trademark is skewering his victims to tree trunks using a hunting crossbow.Now he?s here?For ex-FBI Special Agent Carolyn Ryder, winter is the season to reflect, to come home, to take stock and to grieve. Willow Falls for her is filled with sorrow and regret. She has returned to her hometown to bury her mother after a long battle with illness. </p>

<p>Summary : In I Can Say No, Jenny Simmons teaches children the power of the word &#8220;no.&#8221; Whether it&#8217;s saying no to bullying or someone invading their personal space or simply to playing with a friend when they need some alone time, children learn that they can use their voice to stand up for what is good in the world, and good for themselves.I learned a little word,And even though it&#8217;s small,When I use it with authority,I&#8217;m the strongest of them all!NOThat&#8217;s right. I can say NO.I can say no to a movie I don&#8217;t like.I can say no if I&#8217;m not into riding bikes.I can say no if I want to be alone,Or I&#8217;m feeling kind of tired and would rather stay at home.As parents and educators, we often teach children to use the word &#8220;no&#8221; when they are in danger or when someone is trying to harm them. But &#8220;no&#8221; is powerful in other areas of life, as well. Learning to say &#8220;no&#8221; without feeling guilty or needing to explain themselves gives children the power to protect their boundaries, energy, convictions, and time. </p>

<p>Summary : A wonderful surprise gift from Alan Bennett &#8211; a brand new story, set in a home for the elderly; a glorious, darkly comic treat.We have a choir and on special occasions a glass of dry sherry. It&#8217;s less of a home and more of a club and very much a community. Presided over by the lofty Mrs McBryde, Hill Topp House is a superior council home for the elderly. Among the unforgettable cast of staff and residents there&#8217;s Mr Peckover the deluded archaeologist, Phyllis the knitter, Mr Cresswell the ex-cruise ship hairdresser, the enterprising Mrs Foss and Mr Jimson the chiropodist. Covid is the cause of fatalities and the source of darkly comic confusion, but it&#8217;s also the key to liberation. As staff are hospitalised, protocol breaks down.

<p>Summary : A wonderful surprise gift from Alan Bennett &#8211; a brand new story, set in a home for the elderly; a glorious, darkly comic treat.We have a choir and on special occasions a glass of dry sherry. It&#8217;s less of a home and more of a club and very much a community. Presided over by the lofty Mrs McBryde, Hill Topp House is a superior council home for the elderly. Among the unforgettable cast of staff and residents there&#8217;s Mr Peckover the deluded archaeologist, Phyllis the knitter, Mr Cresswell the ex-cruise ship hairdresser, the enterprising Mrs Foss and Mr Jimson the chiropodist. Covid is the cause of fatalities and the source of darkly comic confusion, but it&#8217;s also the key to liberation. As staff are hospitalised, protocol breaks down.

<p>Summary : For readers of Douglas Stuart and Nick Hornby comes an uproarious, tenderhearted memoir of growing up in working-class Dundee in the 1970s and 1980s.Don Paterson is one of our most acclaimed contemporary poets, possessed of ?an infinite sensitivity to the world? (Zadie Smith). But his current standing gives few hints of his hilariously misspent youth.

<p>Summary : * * * Shortlisted for the 2014 Costa Novel Awards * * *Nora Webster is the heartbreaking new novel from one of the greatest novelists writing today.It is the late 1960s in Ireland. Nora Webster is living in a small town, looking after her four children, trying to rebuild her life after the death of her husband. She is fiercely intelligent, at times difficult and impatient, at times kind, but she is trapped by her circumstances, and waiting for any chance which will lift her beyond them.Slowly, through the gift of music and the power of friendship, she finds a glimmer of hope and a way of starting again. As the dynamic of the family changes, she seems both fiercely self-possessed but also a figure of great moral ambiguity, making her one of the most memorable heroines in contemporary fiction.The portrait that is painted in the years that follow is harrowing, piercingly insightful, always tender and deeply true. Colm T?ib?n&#8217;s Nora is a character as resonant as Anna Karenina or Madame </p>

<p>Summary : November 1911. Lady Emily Hardcastle is celebrating her birthday by seeing a play at the Duke?s Theatre in Bristol with her maid and confidante, the inimitable Flo. Act One is a triumph. Then Act Two opens with a body on stage?a real one. One of the cast has been brutally murdered during the interval.When other matters get in the way of Inspector Sunderland overseeing the case himself, he asks the ever-resourceful Lady H to keep a watchful eye on the suspects?and his police colleagues. Rustling up some cunning disguises of their own, she and Flo are soon in deep cover among the cast and crew, pulling back the curtain on some shocking secrets and rivalries?The problem is, everyone seems to have a motive, and everyone seems to have an alibi?In this locked-room mystery in which nothing is as it seems, the amateur sleuths need to put on the performances of their lives if they?re to stand a chance of shining a spotlight on the truth?</p>

<p>Summary : November 1911. Lady Emily Hardcastle is celebrating her birthday by seeing a play at the Duke?s Theatre in Bristol with her maid and confidante, the inimitable Flo. Act One is a triumph. Then Act Two opens with a body on stage?a real one. One of the cast has been brutally murdered during the interval.When other matters get in the way of Inspector Sunderland overseeing the case himself, he asks the ever-resourceful Lady H to keep a watchful eye on the suspects?and his police colleagues. Rustling up some cunning disguises of their own, she and Flo are soon in deep cover among the cast and crew, pulling back the curtain on some shocking secrets and rivalries?The problem is, everyone seems to have a motive, and everyone seems to have an alibi?In this locked-room mystery in which nothing is as it seems, the amateur sleuths need to put on the performances of their lives if they?re to stand a chance of shining a spotlight on the truth?</p>

<p>Summary : Winfred Rembert grew up as a field hand on a Georgia plantation. He embraced the Civil Rights Movement, endured political violence, survived a lynching, and spent seven years in prison on a chain gang. Years later, seeking a fresh start at the age of 52, he discovered his gift and vision as an artist, and using leather tooling skills he learned in prison, started etching and painting scenes from his youth.Rembert&#8217;s work has been exhibited at museums and galleries across the country, profiled in the New York Times and more, and honored by Bryan Stevenson&#8217;s Equal Justice Initiative. In Chasing Me to My Grave, he relates his life in prose and paintings?vivid, confrontational, revelatory, complex scenes from the cotton fields and chain gangs of the segregated south to the churches and night clubs of the urban north. This is also the story of finding epic love, and with it the courage to revisit a past that begs to remain buried, as told to Tufts philosopher Erin I. Kelly.</p>

<p>Summary : When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum&#8217;s classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?  Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.</p>

<p>Summary : When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum&#8217;s classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?  Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Succede sempre qualcosa di meraviglioso&#8221; ? il racconto di un viaggio che ha come protagonista Davide, un ragazzo che vede tutte le sue certezze crollare una dopo l&#8217;altra, fino a perdere il desiderio di vivere. E Guilly, un personaggio fuori dal tempo che Davide, per caso o per destino, incontra in Vietnam e da cui apprende un modo alternativo e pieno di luce di prendere la vita. Una storia di rinascita in cui perdersi per ritrovarsi, che Gianluca Gotto racconta portando il tema della ricerca della felicit? &#8211; gi? affrontato nell&#8217;autobiografia &#8220;Le coordinate della felicit?&#8221; &#8211; su un piano universale: la destinazione finale di questo viaggio non ? conquistare un certo tipo di vita, ma uno stato d&#8217;animo. Una sensazione di calore che ? sempre dentro di noi, indipendentemente da quello che il destino ci ha riservato. Potremmo chiamarla in tanti modi: serenit?, pace interiore, leggerezza, calma. Oppure, come direbbe Guilly, &#8220;la sensazione di essere a casa, sempre&#8221;.</p>

<p>Summary : Fourth in a series of hardcover box sets celebrating the literary achievement of Christopher Tolkien, featuring double-sided dust jackets?one side featuring artwork by John Howe, and the original graphic treatment on the other. Set 4 contains Morgoth?s Ring, The War of the Jewels, The Peoples of Middle-earth (Books 10?12 of The History of Middle-earth) and The History of Middle-earth Index. <br />
  Morgoth?s Ring <br />
is the first of two companion volumes documenting the later writing of The Silmarillion. The text of the Annals of Aman, the ?Blessed Land? in the far West, is given in full; while further writings reveal the nature of the problems that Tolkien explored in his later years, as new and radical ideas, portending upheaval in the old narratives, emerged at the heart of the mythology. <br />
  The War of the Jewels <br />
continues the account of the later history of The Silmarillion, as the story returns to Middle-earth, and the ruinous conflict of the High Elves and the Men who were their allies </p>

<p>Summary : In No god but God, internationally acclaimed scholar Reza Aslan explains Islam?the origins and evolution of the faith?in all its beauty and complexity. This updated edition addresses the events of the past decade, analyzing how they have influenced Islam?s position in modern culture. Aslan explores what the popular demonstrations pushing for democracy in the Middle East mean for the future of Islam in the region, how the Internet and social media have affected Islam?s evolution, and how the war on terror has altered the geopolitical balance of power in the Middle East. He also provides an update on the contemporary Muslim women?s movement, a discussion of the controversy over veiling in Europe, an in-depth history of Jihadism, and a look at how Muslims living in North America and Europe are changing the face of Islam. Timely and persuasive, No god but God is an elegantly written account that explains this magnificent yet misunderstood faith.</p>

<p>Summary : Os livros s?o a vida de Nora Stephens ? e ela definitivamente n?o ? o tipo de hero?na dos livros. N?o ? a garota impulsiva, nem a descontra?da, muito menos a imagem da meiguice.

Secretamente, Libby espera que uma aut?ntica experi?ncia no interior transforme a vida de Nora, que a irm? est? convencida de que precisa se tornar a hero?na de sua pr?pria hist?ria. Mas, em vez de piqueniques no campo ou encontros inesperados com um belo m?dico, ou quem sabe com um barman musculoso, Nora esbarra em Charlie Lastra, um editor ranzinza que ela conhece de Nova York. Seria um daqueles encontros fofos se n?o fosse o fato de que eles j? se viram antes ? e nunca foi </p>

<p>Summary : The first oral biography of John F. Kennedy Jr. is an extraordinarily intimate, comprehensive look at the real man behind the myth. Sharing never-before-told stories and insights, his closest friends, confidantes, lovers, classmates, teachers, and colleagues paint a vivid portrait of one of the most beloved figures of the 20th century, revealing how the boy who saluted became the man America came to know and love who still captures public imagination twenty-five years after his tragic death.Born into the spotlight, John F. Kennedy Jr. lived a short but remarkable life filled with expectation, ambition, family pressures, love, and tragedy. JFK Jr. dives deep into his complicated psyche and explores the what-ifs, illuminating both the cultural and political moment he inhabited and the way this son of a president, so full of promise and possibility, embodied America?s most cherished hopes.</p>

<p>Summary : From the best-selling author of Wild, a collection of quotes&#8211;drawn from the wide range of her writings&#8211;that capture her wisdom, courage, and outspoken humor, presented in a gift-sized package that&#8217;s as irresistible to give as it is to receive.Around the world, thousands of people have found inspiration in the words of Cheryl Strayed, who in her three prior books and in her &#8220;Dear Sugar&#8221; columns has shared the twists and trials of her remarkable life. Her honesty, spirit, and ample supply of tough love have enabled many of us, even in the darkest hours, to somehow put one foot in front of the other&#8211;and be brave enough.This book gathers, each on a single page, more than 100 of Strayed&#8217;s indelible quotes and thoughts&#8211;&#8220;mini instruction manuals for the soul&#8221; that urge us toward the incredible capacity for love, compassion, forgiveness, and endurance that is within us all.Be brave enough to break your own heart.You can&#8217;t ride to the fair unless you get on the pony.Keep </p>

<p>Summary : Laugh-out-loud, deeply insightful, and emotion-filled essays from multi-talented actress, comedian, podcaster, and writer Casey Wilson.Casey Wilson has a lot on her mind and she isn?t afraid to share. In this dazzling collection of essays, skillfully constructed and brimming with emotion, she shares her thoughts on the joys and vagaries of modern-day womanhood and motherhood, introduces the not-quite-typical family that made her who she is, and persuasively argues that lowbrow pop culture is the perfect lens through which to understand human nature.Whether she?s extolling the virtues of eating in bed, processing the humiliation over her father?s late in life perm, or exploring her pathological need to be liked, Casey is witty, candid, and full of poignant and funny surprises.

Wenn es zu dir geh?rt &#8230; Als Eddie die witzige Fledermaus Eugenia bekommt, w?ren alle aus der Klasse gern an seiner Stelle. Fast alle. Ein M?dchen n?mlich will gar kein magisches Tier haben. Ob die Lehrerin Miss Cornfield damit einverstanden ist? Die gro?e Lesenacht steht an. Doch f?r einige Kinder nimmt der Abend eine gef?hrliche Wendung: Sie finden sich im gruseligen ?Keller des Grauens? wieder ? gefangen tief unter der Schule. K?nnen die magischen Tiere ihnen helfen?</p>

<p>Summary : When a painful loss or life-shattering event upends your world, here is the first thing to know: there is nothing wrong with grief. ?Grief is simply love in its most wild and painful form,? says Megan Devine. ?It is a natural and sane response to loss.? So why does our culture treat grief like a disease to be cured as quickly as possible? In It?s OK That You?re Not OK, Devine offers a profound new approach to both the experience of grief and the way we try to help others who have endured tragedy. Having experienced grief from both sides?as both a therapist and as a woman who witnessed the accidental drowning of her beloved partner?Devine writes with deep insight about the unspoken truths of loss, love, and healing. She debunks the culturally prescribed goal of returning to a normal, ?happy? life, replacing it with a far healthier middle path, one that invites us to build a life alongside grief rather than seeking to overcome it. In this compelling and heartful book, you?ll learn ? </p>

<p>Summary : Like his father and grandfather before him, Kino is a poor diver, gathering pearls from the gulf beds that once brought great wealth to the Kings of Spain and now provide Kino, Juana, and their infant son with meager subsistence. Then, on a day like any other, Kino emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull&#8217;s egg, as &#8220;perfect as the moon.&#8221; With the pearl comes hope, the promise of comfort and of security . . .A story of classic simplicity, based on a Mexican folk tale, The Pearl explores the secrets of man&#8217;s nature, the darkest depths of evil, and the luminous possibilities of love.</p>

<p>Summary : A haunting and beautiful memoir from a Cambodian refugee who lost her country and her family during Pol Pot&#8217;s genocide in the 1970s but who finds hope by reclaiming the recipes she tasted in her mother&#8217;s kitchen. With over 20 Khmer recipes included, Slow Noodles will resonate with readers who loved the food and emotional truth of Michelle Zauner&#8217;s?Crying in H Mart, and it has the staying power of Loung Ung&#8217;s?

<p>Summary : This timely, bestselling novel about a military coup in Turkey, told through the eyes of two children, resonates deeply with events there today.Ankara, the capital city in the heart of Turkey at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, East and West, is a hotspot in the Cold War, torn between communism and conservatism, Western freedoms and traditional ways, with an army fearful of democracy and a government that employs thugs and torture to enforce law and order. In the summer of 1980, tensions are building. Homes of the poor are being burnt down. Armed revolutionaries on college campuses battle right-wings militias in the city&#8217;s neighborhoods. The lines between good and bad, right and wrong, and beautiful and ugly are blurred by shed blood. Two children, one from a family living in misery and one well-off, form an alliance amid the turmoil. Through their senses, the cityscape unfolds its wonders, its rich smells and colors, as they try to make sense of the events swirling around them. </p>

<p>Summary : Bj?rn Diemel wird von seiner Frau gezwungen, ein Achtsamkeits-Seminar zu besuchen, um seine Ehe ins Reine zu bringen, sich als guter Vater zu beweisen und die etwas aus den Fugen geratene Work-Life-Balance wieder herzustellen. Denn Bj?rn ist ein erfolgreicher Anwalt und hat dementsprechend sehr wenig Zeit f?r seine Familie. Der Kurs tr?gt tats?chlich Fr?chte und Bj?rn kann das Gelernte sogar in seinen Job integrieren, allerdings nicht ganz auf die erwartete Weise. Denn als sein Mandant, ein brutaler und mehr als schuldiger Gro?krimineller, beginnt, ihm ernstliche Probleme zu bereiten, bringt er ihn einfach um ? und zwar nach allen Regeln der Achtsamkeit.</p>

Contending with her lack of experience (and the onset of a global pandemic), Alisha gofers for two high-profile Broadway productions (and nearly tramples Stephan Sondheim), attempts to master a fitness regimen called Voga (a cross between yoga and &#8220;voguing&#8221;), feigns confidence while handling </p>

<p>Summary : A Washington Post Notable Book of 2023Plunged into a strange land at twenty-five, Benjamin Moser began an obsessive, decades-long study of the Dutch Masters to set his world right again.Arriving as a young writer in an ancient Dutch town, Benjamin Moser found himself visiting?casually at first, and then more and more obsessively?the country?s great museums. Inside these old buildings, he discovered the remains of the Dutch Golden Age and began to unearth the strange, inspiring, and terrifying stories of the artists who gave shape to one of the most luminous moments in the history of human creativity. Beyond the sainted Rembrandt?who harbored a startling darkness?and the mysterious Vermeer, whose true subject, it turned out, was lurking in plain sight, Moser got to know a whole galaxy of the doomed virtuoso Carel Fabritius, the anguished wunderkind Jan Lievens, the deaf prodigy Hendrik Avercamp.

But Yu has </p>

Her family became her private pantheon, a gathering circle of powerful orisha-like women with tragic real-world wounds, and she vowed to tell their stories&#8211;but first she&#8217;d have to get off the stairs and join the dance. She&#8217;d have to find her language.Weaving together Hudes&#8217;s love of books with the stories of </p>

<p>Summary : In an urgent, deeply personal, riveting plea, Lemon shows us all how deep our problems lie, and what we can do to begin to fix them. Beginning with a letter to one of his Black nephews, he proceeds with reporting and reflections on his slave ancestors, his upbringing in the shadows of segregation, and his adult confrontations with politicians, activists, and scholars. In doing so, Lemon offers a searing and poetic ultimatum to America. He visits the slave port where a direct ancestor was shackled and shipped to America. He recalls a slave uprising in Louisiana, just a few miles from his birthplace. And he takes us to the heart of the 2020 protests in New York City. As he writes to his young nephew: We must resist racism every single day. We must resist it with love.</p>

<p>Summary : In an urgent, deeply personal, riveting plea, Lemon shows us all how deep our problems lie, and what we can do to begin to fix them. Beginning with a letter to one of his Black nephews, he proceeds with reporting and reflections on his slave ancestors, his upbringing in the shadows of segregation, and his adult confrontations with politicians, activists, and scholars. In doing so, Lemon offers a searing and poetic ultimatum to America. He visits the slave port where a direct ancestor was shackled and shipped to America. He recalls a slave uprising in Louisiana, just a few miles from his birthplace. And he takes us to the heart of the 2020 protests in New York City. As he writes to his young nephew: We must resist racism every single day. We must resist it with love.</p>

<p>Summary : Wat als? geeft hilarische en informatieve antwoorden op belangrijke vragen waar je nooit aan zou denken. Randall Munroe is de bedenker van de razend populaire website xkcd.com. Een website die elke week door miljoenen mensen wordt bezocht. Zijn lezers stelde onder andere de volgende vragen:Wat als je een baseball probeert te raken die met 90 procent van de snelheid van het licht op je af komt? Hoe hard kan je over een verkeersdrempel rijden zonder dood te gaan? Wat als de robot het voor het zeggen krijgt, hoe lang zal de mens dan blijven bestaan?De antwoorden van Munroe zijn kleine meesterwerken van duidelijkheid en hilariteit aangevuld met zijn kenmerkende tekeningen. De antwoorden voorspellen vaak volledige vernietiging van de mensheid of op z?n minst een heel grote explosie.</p>

<p>Summary : A solitary woman?s inspiring, moving, surprising, and often funny memoir about the transformative power of her unusual friendship with a wild fox, a new window onto the natural world, and the introduction of a remarkable literary talent.Catherine Raven left home at 15, fleeing an abusive father and an indifferent mother. Drawn to the natural world, for years she worked as a ranger in National Parks, at times living in her run-down car (which lacked a reverse gear), on abandoned construction sites, or camping on a piece of land in Montana she bought from a colleague. She managed to put herself through college and then graduate school, eventually earning a Ph.D. in biology.Yet she never felt at home with people, and though she worked at various universities and taught field classes in the National Parks, she built a house on a remote plot of land in Montana and, except when teaching, spoke to no one. One day, she realized that the fox who had been appearing at her house was coming by </p>

<p>Summary : Melody faces her fears to follow her passion in this stunning sequel to the acclaimed, New York Times bestselling middle grade novel Out of My Mind.Melody, the huge-hearted heroine of Out of My Mind, is a year older, and a year braver. And now with her Medi-talker, she feels nothing?s out of her reach, not even summer camp. There have to be camps for differently-abled kids like her, and she?s going to sleuth one out. A place where she can trek through a forest, fly on a zip line, and even ride on a horse! A place where maybe she really can finally make a real friend, make her own decisions, and even do things on her own?the dream!  By the light of flickering campfires and the power of thunderstorms, through the terror of unexpected creatures in cabins and the first sparkle of a crush, Melody?s about to discover how brave and strong she really is.</p>

<p>Summary : A fearless woman, raised in the forest, fights against a group of powerful men in a novel about good versus evil, the enduring nature of myth, and the power of love by #1 New York Times bestselling author Dean Koontz.Raised in the wilderness by her late great-uncle, Vida is a young woman with an almost preternatural affinity for nature, especially for the wolves that also call the forested mountains home. Formed by hard experience, by love and loss, and by the prophecies of a fortune teller, Vida just wants peace. If only nearby Kettleton County didn?t cast such a dark shadow.It?s where Jose Nochelobo, the love of Vida?s life and a cherished local hero, died in a tragic accident. That?s the official story, but Vida has reasons to doubt it. The truth can?t be contained for long. Nor can the hungry men of power in Kettleton who want something too: that Vida, like Jose, disappear forever. One by one they come for her, prepared to do anything to see their plans through to their evil end. </p>
