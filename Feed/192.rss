<p>Summary : I?ve been in love with Dr. Grant Brighton for four long years.He?s tall. Gorgeous. Brilliant. An amazing single dad.He?s also straight, uninterested in dating someone ten years younger than him, and, tragically, *my boss*.If I?d known taking the nanny position would mean mangling my heart, I might never have accepted his offer, but I love the Brighton family so I?ve resigned myself to never living the fairytale?At least until the Dean of Admissions at the girls? dream school says only families with two parents need apply, and in desperation, Grant makes me a different offer: to be his on-paper *husband*.With things heating up between us and my heart hanging in the balance, how can I convince Grant to make me the proposal I really want: to turn this marriage of convenience into a real-life happily-ever-after?</p>

Bullying, once thought of as the province of queen bees and goons, has taken on new, complex, and insidious forms, as parents and educators know all too well.?No writer is better poised to explore this territory than Emily Bazelon, who has established herself as a leading voice on the social and legal aspects of teenage drama. In Sticks and Stones, she brings readers on a deeply researched, clear-eyed journey into the ever-shifting landscape of teenage meanness and its sometimes devastating consequences. The result is an indispensable book that takes us from school cafeterias to courtrooms to the offices of Facebook, the website where so much teenage life, good and bad, now unfolds.?Along the way, Bazelon defines what bullying is and, just as important, what it is not.

<p>Summary : To catch the killer who eluded her detective grandfather fifty years ago, a true-crime podcaster must contend with outdated evidence, ulterior motives, and the dark family secrets that got in the way.True-crime podcaster Jess Keeler has returned to Deeton County, North Carolina, to pick up where her grandfather left off. Sheriff?s Deputy Big Jim Ballard, her grandfather, was a respected detective?until it all came crashing down during a 1972 murder investigation.For Jim, solving the murders of two teens should have been the highlight of his already storied career. Instead, he battled his own mind, unsure where his hunches ended and the truth began.Working from her grandfather?s disjointed notes, Jess is sure that she can finally put the cold case?and her family?s shame?to rest.

<p>Summary : A manifesto to change how you eat and how you think about the human body.It?s not you, it?s the food.We have entered a new age of eating. For the first time in human history, most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food. There?s a long, formal scientific definition, but it can be boiled down to this: if it?s wrapped in plastic and has at least one ingredient that you wouldn?t find in your kitchen, it?s UPF.These products are specifically engineered to behave as addictive substances, driving excess consumption. They are now linked to the leading cause of early death globally and the number one cause of environmental destruction. Yet almost all our staple foods are ultra-processed. UPF is our food culture and for many people it is the only available and affordable food.In this book, Chris van Tulleken, father, scientist, doctor, and award-winning BBC broadcaster, marshals the latest evidence to show how governments, scientists, and </p>

<p>Summary : Dieci micro storie, dieci incontri con mostri terribili e pericolosi che Lyon, Anna e Giorgio fronteggeranno uniti con intelligenza e una buona dose di coraggio. Un tuffo nel passato, dove la storia dei cacciatori di mostri ha avuto inizio e dove bisogna fare ritorno per comprendere meglio il presente. In un?atmosfera sospesa, ma familiare, Lyon e i suoi amici dovranno sfuggire a creature estranee, che sembrano guidate dall?unica volont? di rubare loro ogni energia e nutrirsi del loro spirito vitale, annientandoli. L?unione tuttavia fa la forza, e cos? i nostri eroi riusciranno a sconfiggere di volta in voltai mostri che li minacciano e a trovare il coraggio di affrontare la nuova sfida che li attende alla prossima tappa. Ma il finale ? ancora tutto da scrivere, e le sorprese non si faranno attendere: la storia dei cacciatori di mostri ? solo all?inizio.</p>

Though he&#8217;d never considered himself a conspiracy theorist, the Manson murders swallowed the next two decades of his career. He was obsessed. Searching but never </p>

What really happened in 1969? In 1999, when Tom O&#8217;Neill was assigned a magazine piece about the thirtieth anniversary of the Manson murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Weren&#8217;t the facts indisputable? Charles Manson had ordered his teenage followers to commit seven brutal murders, and in his thrall, they&#8217;d gladly complied. But when O&#8217;Neill began reporting the story, he kept finding holes in the prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi&#8217;s narrative, long enshrined in the best-selling Helter Skelter. Before long, O&#8217;Neill had questions about everything from the motive to the manhunt.

<p>Summary : He&#8217;d never wanted anyone enough to chase them&#8230; until he met her. Charming, easygoing, and rich beyond belief, Xavier Castillo has the world at his fingertips. He also has no interest in taking over his family&#8217;s empire (much to his father&#8217;s chagrin), but that hasn&#8217;t stopped women from throwing themselves at him&#8230; unless the woman in question is his publicist. Nothing brings him more joy than riling her up, but when a tragedy forces them closer than ever, he must grapple with the uncertainty of his future?and the realization that the only person immune to his charms is the only one he truly wants. *** Cool, intelligent, and ambitious, Sloane Kensington is a high-powered publicist who&#8217;s used to dealing with difficult clients. However, none infuriate?or tempt?her more than a certain billionaire heir, with his stupid dimples and laid-back attitude. She may be forced to work with him, but she&#8217;ll never fall for him&#8230;no matter how fast he makes her heart beat or how thoughtful he is </p>

<p>Summary : In 1864, just prior to the years in which he wrote his greatest novels?Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Possessed and The Brothers Karamazov?Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821?1881) penned the darkly fascinating Notes from the Underground. Its nameless hero is a profoundly alienated individual in whose brooding self-analysis there is a search for the true and the good in a world of relative values and few absolutes. Moreover, the novel introduces themes?moral, religious, political and social?that dominated Dostoyevsky&#8217;s later works. Notes from the Underground, then, aside from its own compelling qualities, offers readers an ideal introduction to the creative imagination, profundity and uncanny psychological penetration of one of the most influential novelists of the nineteenth century. Constance Garnett&#8217;s authoritative translation is reprinted here, with a new introduction.</p>

Notes from the Underground, then, aside from its own compelling qualities, offers readers an ideal introduction to the creative imagination, profundity and uncanny psychological penetration of one of the most influential novelists of the nineteenth century. Constance Garnett&#8217;s authoritative translation is reprinted here, with a new introduction.</p>

<p>Summary : When itinerant cave diver James Tighe receives an invitation to billionaire Nathan Joyce?s private island, he thinks it must be a mistake. But Tighe?s unique skill set makes him a prime candidate for Joyce?s high-risk venture to mine a near-earth asteroid?with the goal of kick-starting an entire off-world economy. The potential rewards and personal risks are staggering, but the competition is fierce and the stakes couldn?t be higher. Isolated and pushed beyond their breaking points, Tighe and his fellow twenty-first century adventurers?ex-soldiers, former astronauts, BASE jumpers, and mountain climbers?must rely on each other to survive not only the dangers of a multi-year expedition but the harsh realities of business in space. They?re determined to transform humanity from an Earth-bound species to a space-faring one?or die trying.</p>

<p>Summary : Anthony Powell&#8217;s universally acclaimed epic A Dance to the Music of Time offers a matchless panorama of twentieth-century London.

The darkly fascinating young Scorpio Murtlock unexpectedly draws Widmerpool into his orbit, calling to mind occult and cultish doings from earlier decades; close friends leave the stage, never to be replaced in this life; and, drawing all the long, tangled strands together, Anthony Powell sounds an unforgettable requiem for an age.&#8221;Anthony Powell is the best living English novelist by far.

The darkly fascinating young Scorpio Murtlock unexpectedly draws Widmerpool into his orbit, calling to mind occult and cultish doings from earlier decades; close friends leave the stage, never to be replaced in this life; and, drawing all the long, tangled strands together, Anthony Powell sounds an unforgettable requiem for an age.&#8221;Anthony Powell is the best living English novelist by far.

<p>Summary : A memoir about one man?s strange upbringing in a family fanatically devoted to honesty ? Raised in what he affectionately calls ?our little honesty cult,? Michael Leviton was ingrained with his parents? core philosophy: You do not tell any lies; you do not withhold the truth; and you speak your mind always, regardless of how offensive or hurtful your opinions may be. For young Michael, this freedom to be yourself?despite being bullied and ostracized at school?felt liberating. By the time Leviton was 29 years old, he had told three (what most people would consider) lies in his entire life. ? But his parents? enthusiasm for ?just being honest? bordered on extreme. After Michael graduated high school and left home, truth telling?in job interviews, on dates, in social interactions?slowly lost its luster. When the only woman who ever appreciated his honesty brought this radical approach to truth into their relationship, Michael decided it was time to embrace the power of lying. To Be </p>

<p>Summary : As a DEA agent, Jeremiah ?Hawk? Tate was one of the best at taking down drug traffickers. Then the cartels struck back?and destroyed everything he held dear.Five years later, Hawk has retreated from society and is living a quiet life as a Montana wilderness guide. He?s done with the DEA, done with the criminals, and done with the pain left over from his past. But his past isn?t done with him.When a mysterious woman offers him an enormous amount of money to find her lost brother, Hawk knows he should walk away, but, with a flash of gunfire, he gets pulled back in. Surrounded by old enemies and allies, he must face off with a new player planning to flood the market with a lethal drug. This may be the chance for revenge Hawk never thought he?d get.Revised edition: Previously published as Krokodil, this edition of Cold Fire includes editorial revisions.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit &#8217;em, but remember it&#8217;s a sin to kill a mockingbird.&#8217;A lawyer&#8217;s advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee&#8217;s classic novel &#8211; a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the thirties. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man&#8217;s struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.</p>

But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.</p>

<p>Summary : I?ve seen every square inch of Violet Eaton?s delectable body and she has no idea who I am.Until now.What happened between us online, in our chats, was meant to stay anonymous and in the past.Until it didn?t.It?s a small world, but Ruby Creek is even smaller. When I move to the tiny town, the grumpy facade I?ve created slips when we?re forced to live under the same roof.Every flush of her cheeks, every time her eyes flare with heat, every time she begs me not to stop, the ice I?ve encased myself in melts. She has me wanting things I can?t want. Things I?ve been dreaming about since I first laid eyes on her two years ago?things I don?t deserve.But my invisible wounds have the power to ruin us both. As a former soldier, I should have the discipline to walk away, but the more I open up to Violet, the more I want to keep her.I came back from the war a different man, but my scars are older and deeper than anyone knows?and I planned to keep it that way. I planned to keep my secrets </p>

<p>Summary : My name is&#8230;One year before a certain useless goddess and NEET extraordinaire hit the scene, Megumin, the &#8220;Greatest Genius of the Crimson Magic Clan,&#8221; is hard at work. Ever since a life-changing encounter in her youth, the young wizard has dedicated her every waking moment to the pursuit of the ultimate offensive magic, Explosion! (Well&#8230;every moment not spent hustling food from her self-proclaimed rival.) And while the big sister&#8217;s away, the little one will play. On a routine trip into the woods, Megumin&#8217;s little sister, Komekko, finds a strange black kitten. Little does she know that this cat plays a key role in unsealing a Dark God&#8217;s tomb&#8230;</p>

They move through a series of axles, cams, and cranks that work like the pistons in an engine. Each model includes a papercraft character that you fold and link with LEGO elements.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it.? Thus wrote Orwell following his experiences as a militiaman in the Spanish Civil War, chronicled in Homage to Catalonia. Here he brings to bear all the force of his humanity, passion, and clarity, describing with bitter intensity the bright hopes and cynical betrayals of that chaotic episode.</p>

<p>Summary : The Diamond: Death walks alongside me, but the reaper is no match for me. I&#8217;m trapped in a world full of monsters dressed as men, and those who aren&#8217;t as they seem. They won&#8217;t keep me forever. I no longer recognize the person I&#8217;ve become, and I&#8217;m fighting to find my way back to the beast who hunts me in the night. They call me a diamond, but they&#8217;ve only created an angel of death.The Hunter: I was born a predator, with ruthlessness ingrained in my bones. When what&#8217;s mine is stolen from me in the night, like a diamond hidden within a fortress, I find that I can no longer contain the beast. Blood will paint the ground as I tear apart this world to find her. And bring her back to where she belongs. No one will escape my wrath, especially not those who have betrayed me.</p>

<p>Summary : From one of Australia&#8217;s most brilliant writers, a dark comedy about the tangled fates of two couples and the children trapped between themMichael and Mary Shelley are Christian fanatics who loathe their fellow Australians ? especially their &#8216;foul language, reckless indulgence of alcohol and obsession with idiotic ball sports&#8217;.Lenore and Tom Blaine are working-class Queensland publicans raising a large family in a raucous, loving, rugby-league-obsessed home.There&#8217;s just one problem. The Blaines are foster parents to three of the Shelleys&#8217; children, who were removed from Michael and Mary as infants. And the Shelleys are prepared to do anything to get them back.

<p>Summary : This poetic, genre-bending work?blending memoir with cultural history?from Whiting Award winner Nadia Owusu grapples with the fault lines of identity, the meaning of home, black womanhood, and the ripple effects, both personal and generational, of emotional trauma. Nadia Owusu grew up all over the world?from Rome and London to Dar-es-Salaam and Kampala. When her mother abandoned her when she was two years old, the rejection caused Nadia to be confused about her identity. Even after her father died when she was thirteen and she was raised by her stepmother, she was unable to come to terms with who she was since she still felt motherless and alone. When Nadia went to university in America when she was eighteen she still felt as if she had so many competing personas that she couldn?t keep track of them all without cracking under the pressure of trying to hold herself together. A powerful coming-of-age story that explores timely and universal themes of identity, Aftershocks follows </p>

In her brutally honest, hilarious, heartbreaking memoir, she reveals what was going on behind the scenes of her sometimes tumultuous personal and professional life &#8211; a story she?s never shared, until now. Of the medium she loves, the one that made her a household name, she says, ?Television can put you in a box; the flat-screen can flatten. On TV, you are larger than life but smaller, too. It is not the whole story, and it is not the whole me. This book is.?Beginning in early childhood, Couric was inspired by her journalist father to pursue the career he loved but couldn?t afford to stay in.

Here too is a 1976 piece from the New York Times magazine on &#8220;Why I Write&#8221;; a piece about short stories from New West in 1978; and from The New Yorker, a piece on Hemingway from 1998, and on Martha Stewart from 2000.

<p>Summary : The authors of Douglass and Lincoln present fully for the first time the story of Martin Luther King, Jr.?s imprisonment in the days leading up to the 1960 presidential election and the efforts of three of John F. Kennedy?s civil rights staffers who went rogue to free him?a move that changed the face of the Democratic Party and propelled Kennedy to the White House.Less than three weeks before the 1960 presidential election, thirty-one-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr. was arrested at a sit-in at Rich?s Department Store in Atlanta. That day would lead to the first night King had ever spent in jail?and the time that King?s family most feared for his life.An earlier, minor traffic ticket served as a pretext for keeping King locked up, and later for a harrowing nighttime transfer to Reidsville, the notorious Georgia state prison where Black inmates worked on chain gangs overseen by violent white guards.

<p>Summary : One woman learns the secrets of the five Jaeger brothers. On the other side of town, in the dark glades, under the rain? Macon is the oldest. Thirty-one. Ex-Marine. I don?t think I?ve ever seen him smile. Army is twenty-eight. A single dad with the most beautiful green eyes. He has no idea who he is, if not a Jaeger brother. Iron will be in prison soon. You?d never think it to meet him. He?s a nice guy, actually. But he can?t stop reacting to everything. Dallas is the one I hate. Twenty-one, cruel, and selfish. He takes and then throws away whatever?s left. And Trace is mine. Or he was for about two seconds. No one can tame him for long. Not that I ever wanted to. It was fun, but now I need to go home. Back to my side of the tracks. Away from the swamps and these men. To my parents? big house. On my clean street. Where I?m never dirty or messy or hot. And I will. I?ll leave first thing tomorrow morning. I just want to crash on the couch tonight. Their house is dark and quiet, </p>

<p>Summary : A luminous and haunting memoir from the prize-winning poet &#8211; a story of love, heartbreak and coming of age, and a fearless exploration of queer identity and trauma. When Se?n meets Elias, the two fall headlong into a love story. But as Elias struggles with severe depression, the couple comes face-to-face with crisis. Wrestling with this, Se?n Hewitt delves deep into his own history, enlisting the ghosts of queer figures and poets before him. From a nineteenth-century cemetery in Liverpool to the pine forests of Gothenburg, Hewitt plumbs the darkness in search of solace and hope. All Down Darkness Wide is an unflinching meditation on the burden of living in a world that too often sets happiness and queer life at odds, and a tender portrayal of what it&#8217;s like to be caught in the undertow of a loved one&#8217;s suffering. By turns devastating and soaring, it is a mesmerising story of heartache and renewal, and a work of rare and transcendent beauty.</p>

Wrestling with this, Se?n Hewitt delves deep into his own history, enlisting the ghosts of queer figures and poets before him. From a nineteenth-century cemetery in Liverpool to the pine forests of Gothenburg, Hewitt plumbs the darkness in search of solace and hope. All Down Darkness Wide is an unflinching meditation on the burden of living in a world that too often sets happiness and queer life at odds, and a tender portrayal of what it&#8217;s like to be caught in the undertow of a loved one&#8217;s suffering. By turns devastating and soaring, it is a mesmerising story of heartache and renewal, and a work of rare and transcendent beauty.</p>

There?s no Last Dance documentary. There?s no ?Michael Jordan? as we know him. The 1990s Chicago Bulls teams would not exist as we know them.So how did the youngest of twelve go from growing up poor in the small town of Hamburg, Arkansas, enduring two family tragedies along the way, to become a revered NBA legend? How did the scrawny teen, overlooked by every major collegiate basketball program, go on to become the fifth overall pick in the 1987 NBA Draft? And, perhaps most </p>

<p>Summary : Thomas Jefferson asserted that if there was any leader of the Revolution, ?Samuel Adams was the man.? With high-minded ideals and bare-knuckle tactics, Adams led what could be called the greatest campaign of civil resistance in American history. ? Stacy Schiff returns Adams to his seat of glory, introducing us to the shrewd and eloquent man who supplied the moral backbone of the American Revolution. A singular figure at a singular moment, Adams amplified the Boston Massacre. He helped to mastermind the Boston Tea Party. He employed every tool available to rally a town, a colony, and eventually a band of colonies behind him, creating the cause that created a country. For his efforts he became the most wanted man in America: When Paul Revere rode to Lexington in 1775, it was to warn Samuel Adams that he was about to be arrested for treason. In The Revolutionary: Samuel Adams, Schiff brings her masterful skills to Adams?s improbable life, illuminating his transformation from aimless son </p>

  Previously published as Wishes <br />
No Matter How Fast You Run?The newborn baby boy is beautiful, perfect, and hers for the asking. All Kate Summers has to do is agree to one condition?she must disappear from Boston and never breathe a word about the adoption to anyone. <br />
  Or How Far You Go? <br />
Fifteen years later, Kate has built a good life for herself and her son, Jon, in Hopewell, Oregon. Still, she is haunted by the fear that he will somehow be taken away. Then Daegan O&#8217;Rourke arrives in town and strikes up a friendship with her and Jon. But Daegan has his own past to hide?one with shocking ties to hers. <br />
  A Killer Will Always Find You? <br />
Someone is watching Kate, watching her son, and is willing to go to any lengths to claim him. And the one man Kate is tempted to trust has dangerous secrets that could change her world forever. Soon the past Kate thought she could outrun will explode, unearthing a legacy of lies and treachery, and a fury powerful enough to kill?</p>

<p>Summary : A fascinating, revelatory memoir revealing the author?s struggle to come to terms with her own sociopathy and shed light on the often maligned and misunderstood mental disorder.Patric Gagne realized she made others uncomfortable before she started kindergarten. Something about her caused people to react in a way she didn?t understand. She suspected it was because she didn?t feel things the way other kids did. Emotions like fear, guilt, and empathy eluded her. For the most part, she felt nothing.

So Patric stole. She lied. She was occasionally violent. She became an expert lock-picker and home-invader. All with the goal of replacing the nothingness with&#8230;something.In college, Patric finally confirmed what she?d long suspected. She was a sociopath. But even though it was the very </p>

<p>Summary : From the Booker Prize finalist author of The Island of Missing Trees, an enchanting new tale about three characters living along two rivers, all under the shadow of one of the greatest epic poems of all time.In the ancient city of Nineveh, on the bank of the River Tigris, King Ashurbanipal of Mesopotamia, erudite but ruthless, built a great library that would crumble with the end of his reign.

<p>Summary : An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here.An acknowledged masterpiece, this is the story of seven generations of the Buendia family and of Macondo, the town they have built. Though little more than a settlement surrounded by mountains, Macondo has its wars and disasters, even its wonders and miracles. A microcosm of Columbian life, its secrets lie hidden, encoded in a book and only Aureliano Buendia can fathom its mysteries and reveal its shrouded destiny. Blending political reality with magic realism, fantasy with comic invention, &#8220;One Hundred Years of Solitude&#8221; is one of the most daringly original works of the twentieth century.</p>

Though little more than a settlement surrounded by mountains, Macondo has its wars and disasters, even its wonders and miracles. A microcosm of Columbian life, its secrets lie hidden, encoded in a book and only Aureliano Buendia can fathom its mysteries and reveal its shrouded destiny. Blending political reality with magic realism, fantasy with comic invention, &#8220;One Hundred Years of Solitude&#8221; is one of the most daringly original works of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Summary : Is IQ destiny? Not nearly as much as we think. Daniel Goleman argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, and that our emotions play a far greater role in thought, decision making and individual success than is commonly acknowledged.Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people who excel: whose relationships flourish, who are stars in the workplace.With new insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality, Goleman shows precisely how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. And because emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain&#8217;s circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can benefit from this.</p>

<p>Summary : A striking and remarkable literary memoir about one family&#8217;s transformation, with almost all of them embracing their queer identities.Jessi Hempel was raised in a seemingly picture-perfect, middle-class American family. But the truth was far from perfect. Her father was constantly away from home, traveling for work, while her stay-at-home mother became increasingly lonely and erratic. Growing up, Jessi and her two siblings struggled to make sense of their family, their world, their changing bodies, and the emotional turmoil each was experiencing. And each, in their own way, was hiding their true self from the world.By the time Jessi reached adulthood, everyone in her family had come out: Jessi as gay, her sister as bisexual, her father as gay, her brother as transgender, and her mother as a survivor of a traumatic experience with an alleged serial killer. Yet coming out was just the beginning, starting a chain reaction of other personal revelations and reckonings that caused each of </p>

<p>Summary : In this companion tale to the bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series, Feyre, Rhys and their friends are working to rebuild the Night Court and the vastly changed world beyond after the events of A Court of Wings and Ruin. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it a hard-earned reprieve. Yet even the festive atmosphere can&#8217;t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated ? scars that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of their court.</p>
