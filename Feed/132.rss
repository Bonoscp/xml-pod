<p>Summary : Cambridge Clarion Bibles bring together several attractive design features&#8211;readable print, single-column layout, and paragraph format&#8211;in a personal size Bible. The text runs right across the page, with the cross-references moved to the outer margin, to give the page a very well-laid-out appearance. The type size is just under 9 point with generous line spacing, making the Bible text extremely clear and readable. The Bible has 15 new color maps and a concordance.

<p>Summary : Aveva quattordici anni Smita quando con la sua famiglia ha dovuto lasciare l?India in circostanze drammatiche. Una volta al sicuro in America, ha scacciato dal cuore la nostalgia per i crepuscoli aranciati e il profumo inebriante dei cibi che il padre le comprava dai venditori ambulanti e giurato a se stessa che mai pi? sarebbe tornata in quei luoghi che l?avevano cos? profondamente ferita.Ma anni dopo si ritrova a dover accettare con riluttanza l?incarico di coprire una storia di cronaca a Mumbai, per il suo giornale. Seguendo il caso di Meena ? una giovane donna sfigurata brutalmente dai suoi fratelli e dai membri del suo villaggio per aver sposato un uomo di un?altra religione ? Smita si ritrova di nuovo faccia a faccia con una societ? che appena fuori dallo skyline luccicante delle metropoli le pare cristallizzata in un eterno Medioevo, in cui le tradizioni hanno pi? valore del cuore del singolo, e con una storia che minaccia di portare alla luce tutti i dolorosi segreti del suo </p>

<p>Summary : In this delightfully witty Victorian romance, a governess spy running away from her past falls for an ex-soldier turned railroad magnate. The utterly charming Emily Leverton has a dark past and is determined to leave it behind in her respectable new role as a governess. But when she is recruited by a secret network of governesses who spy on the?ton,?it may just be a way to redeem the dark secrets of her past. Straddling the worlds of the?ton?and the working class, as an ex-solider turned railroad magnate, Zach?hunts killers for the Metropolitan Police by day and dutifully attends balls at night. In neither world has he met a woman with the brazenness to mock him. So when a saucy governess blows him a kiss he is determined to catch her, never expecting that when he does he will find an intelligent, quirky woman hiding more than her true name.?As Zach peels back the layers of Emily?s lies, he falls for the street-wise woman who handles a dagger like a pro and kisses like a mistress. </p>

<p>Summary : Um romance sobre identidade e as complexas rela??es raciais, sobre viol?ncia e negritude, O avesso da pele ? uma obra contundente no panorama da nova fic??o liter?ria brasileira.O avesso da pele ? a hist?ria de Pedro, que, ap?s a morte do pai, assassinado numa desastrosa abordagem policial, sai em busca de resgatar o passado da fam?lia e refazer os caminhos paternos. Com uma narrativa sens?vel e por vezes brutal, Jeferson Ten?rio traz ? superf?cie um pa?s marcado pelo racismo e por um sistema educacional falido, e um denso relato sobre as rela??es entre pais e filhos.O que est? em jogo ? a vida de um homem abalado pelas inevit?veis fraturas existenciais da sua condi??o de negro em um pa?s racista, um processo de dor, de acerto de contas, mas tamb?m de reden??o, supera??o e liberdade. Com habilidade incomum para conceber e estruturar personagens e de lidar com as complexidades e pequenas trag?dias das rela??es familiares, Jeferson Ten?rio se consolida como uma das vozes mais potentes </p>

<p>Summary : Readers of Sandra Brown&#8217;s fifty other bestsellers will recognize the smoldering heat, the sensuality, and the scandal that can pervade her settings, and the feisty independence of her heroines.

Scott, beginning with the 1983  Marine barracks bombing in Beirut.  1983: the United States Marine Corps experiences its greatest single-day loss of life since the Battle of Iwo Jima when a truck packed with explosives crashes into their headquarters and barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. This horrifying terrorist attack, which killed 241 servicemen, continues to influence US foreign policy and haunts the Marine Corps to this day. Now, the full story is revealed as never before by Jack Carr and historian and Pulitzer Prize finalist James M. Scott.

<p>Summary : Luna Bodman always looks forward to a new shipment of furniture at the restoration shop. Her brother, Cullen, has a knack for finding discarded pieces with an intriguing history, and Luna likes to sit with each item to see if she can feel any kind of vibrations. Usually, Cullen does his thing while Luna does hers, but the arrival of an old armoire triggers a reaction in Luna that?s impossible to ignore.From the moment Luna wiggles inside the armoire and closes her eyes, she feels an overpowering and disturbing sensation. Emerging, she asks for a flashlight and discovers words scraped into the wood: ?Help me!? Hoping to uncover the piece?s secrets, Luna contacts her good friend, U.S. Marshall Christopher Gaines, and the group sets out to trace the armoire?s origins. The journey takes them to a military school in New England, and a mysterious, long-ago ransom case. The kidnappers were never found, but decades later, the answers may finally be within reach &#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : A fearless woman, raised in the forest, fights against a group of powerful men in a novel about good versus evil, the enduring nature of myth, and the power of love by #1 New York Times bestselling author Dean Koontz.Raised in the wilderness by her late great-uncle, Vida is a young woman with an almost preternatural affinity for nature, especially for the wolves that also call the forested mountains home. Formed by hard experience, by love and loss, and by the prophecies of a fortune teller, Vida just wants peace. If only nearby Kettleton County didn?t cast such a dark shadow.It?s where Jose Nochelobo, the love of Vida?s life and a cherished local hero, died in a tragic accident. That?s the official story, but Vida has reasons to doubt it. The truth can?t be contained for long. Nor can the hungry men of power in Kettleton who want something too: that Vida, like Jose, disappear forever. One by one they come for her, prepared to do anything to see their plans through to their evil end. </p>

<p>Summary : An Accessible, Up-to-Date Intermediate Greek GrammarThis intermediate grammar for students of New Testament Greek incorporates the advances of recent linguistic research in an accessible and understandable way.

  New York Times <br />
 bestselling author Susan Wiggs writes with heartwarming delicacy about life?s unexpected turns, and how family and love can help you find your way home. Lily Robinson and Sean McGuire have nothing in common. She guards her independent lifestyle with a ferocity that hides a fear of love and the pain it can bring. He?s always been a rolling stone, making his own way. But with the sudden deaths of a couple close to them both, the two become joined in grief and a knowledge that they must step up and care for the three orphaned children. With little more than hope and dedication, these five embark on a cross-country road trip filled with the ups and downs, the joys and frustrations that make up a family. Along the way, Lily and Sean and these troubled children will discover that even when you?ve lost everything, love still remains.Originally published in 2005.Includes an exclusive excerpt from BETWEEN YOU AND ME by Susan Wiggs, coming </p>

<p>Summary : The bestselling, beloved writer of romantic comedies like You&#8217;ve Got Mail tells her own late-in-life love story, complete with a tragic second act and joyous resolution.Delia Ephron had struggled through several years of heartbreak. She?d lost her sister, Nora, and then her husband, Jerry, both to cancer. Several months after Jerry?s death, she decided to make one small change in her life?she shut down his landline, which crashed her internet. She ended up in Verizon hell.?She channeled her grief the best way she knew: by writing a New York Times op-ed. The piece caught the attention of Peter, a Bay Area psychiatrist, who emailed her to commiserate. Recently widowed himself, he reminded her that they had shared a few dates fifty-four years before, set up by Nora. Delia did not remember him, but after several weeks of exchanging emails and sixties folk songs, he flew east to see her. They were crazy, utterly, in love.?But this was not a rom-com: four months later she was diagnosed </p>

Several months after Jerry?s death, she decided to make one small change in her life?she shut down his landline, which crashed her internet. She ended up in Verizon hell.?She channeled her grief the best way she knew: by writing a New York Times op-ed. The piece caught the attention of Peter, a Bay Area psychiatrist, who emailed her to commiserate. Recently widowed himself, he reminded her that they had shared a few dates fifty-four years before, set up by Nora. Delia did not remember him, but after several weeks of exchanging emails and sixties folk songs, he flew east to see her. They were crazy, utterly, in love.?But this was not a rom-com: four months later she was diagnosed </p>

<p>Summary : Het wordt tijd dat we werk gaan omdenken. Want waarom werken wij eigenlijk? En waarom spelen we op ons werk vaak een rol? Waarom timmeren we alles dicht met eindeloze regelgeving en maken onze ?oplossingen? de problemen alleen maar erger? Waarom gedraagt de ??n zich op het werk als kleuter en de ander als een bully? We werken in een wereld van druk-druk-druk, stress en burn-out en er is veel onderling wantrouwen tussen werkgevers en werknemers. Dat bracht Berthold Gunster bij de belangrijke vraag: hoe zouden we deze problemen op het werk kunnen omdenken?Als aanvulling op de reeks met de succesvolle boekjes Omdenken, Omdenken in communicatie en Omdenken in opvoeding, duiken we nu in het anders aanpakken van al het gedoe op het werk.Berthold Gunster onderzoekt de verwachtingen die we hebben omtrent werk. Ook houdt hij de lezer een spiegel voor en laat zien dat we allemaal last hebben van een oplossingsreflex waarmee we problemen juist vastdenken: van een probleem een ramp maken.Maar </p>

In any case, you can be sure that, as April approaches, he&#8217;ll make it a point of honor to respect the tradition of April Fool&#8217;s jokes, as surely as zero + zero = Toto&#8217;s mind!</p>

<p>Summary : A moving, heartbreaking, and lyrical true story of the author&#8217;s escape from an apocalyptic cult&#8211;and the survival skills that led to her freedom.As a child, Michelle Dowd grew up on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest. She was born into an ultra-religious cult&#8211;or the Field as they called it&#8211;started in the 1930s by her grandfather, a mercurial, domineering, and charismatic man who convinced generations of young male followers that he would live 500 years and ascend to the heavens when doomsday came. Comfort and care are sins, Michelle is told. As a result, she was forced to learn the skills necessary to battle hunger, thirst, and cold; she learned to trust animals more than humans; and most importantly, she learned how to survive in the natural world. At the Field, a young Michelle lives a life of abuse, poverty, and isolation, as she obeys her family&#8217;s rigorous religious and patriarchal rules&#8211;which are so extreme that Michelle is convinced her mother would sacrifice her, </p>

<p>Summary : From visionary director Jon M. Chu comes a powerful, inspiring memoir of belonging, creativity, and learning to see who you really are. Long before he directed Wicked, In The Heights, or the groundbreaking film Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu was a movie-obsessed first-generation Chinese American, helping at his parents? Chinese restaurant in Silicon Valley and forever facing the cultural identity crisis endemic to children of immigrants. Growing up on the cutting edge of twenty-first-century technology gave Chu the tools he needed to make his mark at USC film school, and to be discovered by Steven Spielberg, but he soon found himself struggling to understand who he was. In this book, for the first time, Chu turns the lens on his own life and work, telling the universal story of questioning what it means when your dreams collide with your circumstances, and showing how it?s possible to succeed even when the world changes beyond all recognition.?With striking candor and unrivaled </p>

<p>Summary : The seminal work of speculative fiction from the Booker Prize-winning author, soon to be a Hulu series starring Elizabeth Moss, Samira Wiley, and Joseph Fiennes.Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the days before, when she lived and made love with her husband Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now&#8230;. Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and literary tour de force.</p>

<p>Summary : Amelia Peabody, that indomitable product of the Victorian age, embarks on her debut Egyptian adventure armed with unshakable self-confidence, a journal to record her thoughts, and, of course, a sturdy umbrella. On her way to Cairo, Amelia rescues young Evelyn Barton-Forbes, who has been abandoned by her scoundrel lover. Together the two women sail up the Nile to an archeological site run by the Emerson brothers-the irascible but dashing Radcliffe and the amiable Walter. Soon their little party is increased by one-one mummy that is, and a singularly lively example of the species.Strange visitations, suspicious accidents, and a botched kidnapping convince Amelia that there is a plot afoot to harm Evelyn. Now Amelia finds herself up against an unknown enemy-and perilous forces that threaten to make her first Egyptian trip also her last . . .</p>

<p>Summary : A gripping historical mystery inspired by the life and diary of Martha Ballard, a renowned 18th-century midwife who defied the legal system and wrote herself into American history.Maine, 1789: When the Kennebec River freezes, entombing a man in the ice, Martha Ballard is summoned to examine the body and determine cause of death. As a midwife and healer, she is privy to much of what goes on behind closed doors in Hallowell. Her diary is a record of every birth and death, crime and debacle that unfolds in the close-knit community. Months earlier, Martha documented the details of an alleged rape committed by two of the town?s most respected gentlemen?one of whom has now been found dead in the ice. But when a local physician undermines her conclusion, declaring the death to be an accident, Martha is forced to investigate the shocking murder on her own.Over the course of one winter, as the trial nears, and whispers and prejudices mount, Martha doggedly pursues the truth. Her diary soon </p>

<p>Summary : Jacqueline Woodson?s National Book Award and Newbery Honor winner, now available in paperback with seven new, original poems. A President Obama &#8220;O&#8221; Book Club pickRaised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child&#8217;s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson&#8217;s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.Includes 7 new poems, including &#8220;Brown Girl Dreaming.&#8221;Praise for Jacqueline Woodson:A 2016 National Book Award finalist </p>

<p>Summary : The award-winning journalist and co-host of CBS Saturday Morning tells the candid, and deeply personal story of her mother&#8217;s abandonment and how the search for answers forced her to reckon with her own identity and the secrets that shaped her family for five decades.Though Michelle Miller was an award-winning broadcast journalist for CBS News, few people in her life knew the painful secret she carried: her mother had abandoned her at birth. Los Angeles in 1967 was deeply segregated, and her mother&#8211;a Chicana hospital administrator who presented as white, had kept her affair with Michelle&#8217;s father, Dr. Ross Miller, a married trauma surgeon and Compton&#8217;s first Black city councilman&#8211;hidden, along with the unplanned pregnancy. Raised largely by her father and her paternal grandmother, Michelle had no knowledge of the woman whose genes she shared. Then, fate intervened when Michelle was twenty-two. As her father lay stricken with cancer, he told her, &#8220;Go and find your mother.&#8221;Belonging </p>

<p>Summary : A history-making once-in-a-century volcanic eruption is about to destroy the Big Island of Hawaii. But a decades-old military secret could turn the volcano into something even more terrifying&#8230; Now it&#8217;s up to a handful of brave individuals to save the island &#8211; and the entire world.Two of the bestselling storytellers of all time have created an unforgettable thriller. The master of the techno-blockbuster joins forces with the master of the modern thriller to create the most anticipated mega bestseller in years. Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park, ER, Twister, and Westworld, had a passion project he?d been pursuing for years, ahead of his untimely passing in 2008. Knowing how special it was, his wife, Sherri Crichton, held back his notes and the partial manuscript until she found the right author to complete it: James Patterson, the world?s most popular storyteller. Eruption brings the pace of Patterson to the concept of Crichton: the most anticipated mega-thriller in years.</p>

<p>Summary : The seductive and action-packed follow-up to Alex Aster?s instant #1 New York Times, #1 Wall Street Journal, and internationally bestselling novel, LightlarkIsla Crown has secured the love of two powerful rulers and broken the curses that plagued the six realms for centuries, but few know the true origins of her powers.Now, in the wake of a crushing betrayal, Isla finds herself struggling to win respect as the newly crowned leader of two separate realms. Worse, her fellow rulers haven?t ceded victory quietly, and there are others in Isla?s midst who don?t believe her ascent to power was earned.As certain death races toward Lightlark and secrets from the past begin to unravel, Isla must weigh her responsibility to her people against the whims of the most dangerous traitor of all: her heart.Alex Aster?s intricate world expands after the riveting culmination of the Centennial games, delving more deeply into Isla?s memories of her past, as her future hurtles toward two possible fates.</p>

<p>Summary : One of Atlas &amp; Boots&#8217; Top 10 Adventure Travel Books of 2021 A dramatic account of the deadly earthquake on Everest&#8211;and a return to reach the summit.On April 25, 2015, Jim Davidson was climbing Mount Everest when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake released avalanches all around him and his team, destroying their only escape route and trapping them at nearly 20,000 feet. It was the largest earthquake in Nepal in eighty-one years and killed about 8,900 people. That day also became the deadliest in the history of Everest, with eighteen people losing their lives on the mountain.After spending two unsettling days stranded on Everest, Davidson&#8217;s team was rescued by helicopter. The experience left him shaken, and despite his thirty-three years of climbing and serving as an expedition leader, he wasn&#8217;t sure that he would ever go back. But in the face of risk and uncertainty, he returned in 2017 and finally achieved his dream of reaching the summit.Suspenseful and engrossing, The Next Everest </p>

Nicesini gazetelerin i? sayfalar?nda okuyup ge?ti?imiz bir cinayeti ele alan P?nar K?r, kad?na kar?? ?r?lm?? yarg?n?n ard?nda yatan toplumsal dokuyu da t?m ger?ekli?iyle masaya yat?r?yor.?Her biri kendi i? b?t?nl???nde, alabildi?ine ?znel tutulan ?? s?ylem: ??kar?n? ?ortak bilin?in ??kar?yla b?t?nle?tirmi? Faik ?rfan Elverir?in insanl?ktan soyutlanm?? s?ylemi. Cinsel bir nesne, somut bir ?aresizlik, tam bir kurban konumuna yarg?l? Melek?in, sesi olmayan s?ylemi.Ve ?a?k?n, toy bir iyi niyetin ??kmaz?nda bocalayan Yal??n??n edilginli?i a?amayan bilincinden yans?yan s?ylemi.

P?nar K?r??n, y?rekli bir toplumsal ele?tiriyi </p>

<p>Summary : The long-awaited memoir by one of the most important political leaders of our timeFor 16 years, Angela Merkel bore the governmental responsibility for Germany, leading the country through numerous crises and shaping German and international politics and society with her actions and attitude. But Angela Merkel was not born a Chancellor. In her memoirs, co-written with her long-standing political advisor Beate Baumann, she looks back on her life in two German states ? 35 years in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), 35 years in reunified Germany. More personally than ever before, she talks about her childhood, youth, and her studies in the GDR, and the dramatic year of 1989, when the Wall fell and her political life began. She shares insights into her meetings and conversations with the world&#8217;s most powerful leaders and elucidates, with clear and precise examples, significant national, European, and international turning points and how decisions were made that shape our times.
