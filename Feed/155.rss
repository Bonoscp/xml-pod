<p>Summary : After The Joker?s death, Batman and Gotham City face a mysterious new threat in this direct sequel to Tim Burton?s iconic Batman.The Joker is dead, but not forgotten. Gotham City is saved, but it is still not safe. By night, its new symbol of hope, Batman, continues his fight to protect the innocent and the powerless.

But even after death, the Clown Prince of Crime?s imprint can be seen in more than just the pavement. Remnants from The Joker?s gang are leading wannabes fascinated by his bizarre mystique on a campaign of arson that threatens the city?even as it serves greedy opportunists, including millionaire Max Shreck. And survivors of exposure to The Joker?s chemical weapon Smylex continue to crowd Gotham City?s main hospital. To quell the chaos, Batman needs more than his </p>

<p>Summary : From international drag superstar and pop culture icon RuPaul, comes his most revealing and personal work to date?a brutally honest, surprisingly poignant, and deeply intimate memoir of growing up Black, poor, and queer in a broken home to discovering the power of performance, found family, and self-acceptance. A profound introspection of his life, relationships, and identity,? The House of Hidden Meanings ?is a self-portrait of the legendary icon on the road to global fame and changing the way the world thinks about drag. Central to RuPaul?s success has been his chameleonic adaptability. From drag icon to powerhouse producer of one of the world?s largest television franchises, RuPaul?s ever-shifting nature has always been part of his brand as both supermodel and supermogul. Yet that adaptability has made him enigmatic to the public. In this memoir, his most intimate and detailed book yet, RuPaul makes himself truly known. Stripping away all artifice, RuPaul recounts the story of his </p>

Ballard ha appena scoperto una corrispondenza tra il DNA di un uomo recentemente arrestato e uno stupratore e assassino seriale scomparso vent&#8217;anni fa.

<p>Summary : Ren?e Ballard e Harry Bosch: una squadra perfetta, specie quando si tratta di cold case. Ballard ha appena scoperto una corrispondenza tra il DNA di un uomo recentemente arrestato e uno stupratore e assassino seriale scomparso vent&#8217;anni fa. L&#8217;uomo ha solo ventiquattro anni, quindi il legame genetico deve essere familiare: ? chiaro che ad aver ucciso e seminato il terrore tanti anni prima ? stato il padre del ragazzo. Ma non sar? facile provarlo&#8230; E sar? impossibile farlo senza Bosch. Nel frattempo Maddie Bosch, figlia di Harry e nuova agente di pattuglia, viene arruolata come volontaria nell&#8217;Unit? Casi Irrisolti. Maddie ha una ragione molto personale per volere l&#8217;accesso alla biblioteca delle anime perdute della citt?: un cold case che potrebbe fare la storia del crimine.</p>

I knew he wasn?t mine to keep.So why, when I finally try to get over him, does he sweep back into town? Why is he upset? Why is there tension between us for the first time in years?I never saw a future where Lucky could be mine. But now, unless I want to lose my friend, I might not have a choice but to tell the truth. My heart belongs to him. It has from the start.If only I knew how to hold onto a creature that?s meant to fly.To Catch a Firefly is a standalone, childhood friends-to-lovers romance told </p>

<p>Summary : With the stock market breaking records almost daily, leaving longtime market analysts shaking their heads and revising their forecasts, a study of the concept of risk seems quite timely. Peter Bernstein has written a comprehensive history of man&#8217;s efforts to understand risk and probability, beginning with early gamblers in ancient Greece, continuing through the 17th-century French mathematicians Pascal and Fermat and up to modern chaos theory. Along the way he demonstrates that understanding risk underlies everything from game theory to bridge-building to winemaking.</p>

<p>Summary : A must-read war memoir&#8230; with zero punches pulled, related by one of the most incisive observers of the American political scene. &#8211;KIRKUS (starred review) Funny, biting, thoughtful and wholly original. &#8211;Tim O&#8217;Brien, author of The Things They CarriedJeff Danziger, one of the leading political cartoonists of his generation, captures the fear, sorrow, absurdity, and unintended but inevitable consequences of war with dark humor and penetrating moral clarity.</p>
<p>If there is any discipline at the start of wars it dissipates as the soldiers themselves become aware of the pointlessness of what they are being told to do.A conversation with a group of today&#8217;s military age men and women about America&#8217;s involvement in Vietnam inspired Jeff Danziger to write about his own wartime experiences: &#8220;War is interesting,&#8221; he reveals, &#8220;if you can avoid getting killed, and don&#8217;t mind loud noises.&#8221;Fans of his cartooning will recognize his mordant humor applied to his own wartime training and combat </p>

<p>Summary : From PEN/America Award winner, 2021 Guggenheim fellow, and beloved literary and tarot icon Michelle Tea, the hilarious, powerfully written, taboo-breaking story of her journey to pregnancy and motherhood as a 40 year-old, queer, uninsured womanWritten in intimate, gleefully TMI prose, Knocking Myself Up is the irreverent account of Tea&#8217;s route to parenthood&#8211;with a group of ride-or-die friends, a generous drag queen, and a whole lot of can-do pluck. Along the way she falls in love with a wholesome genderqueer a decade her junior, attempts biohacking herself a baby with black market fertility meds (and magicking herself an offspring with witch-enchanted honey), learns her eggs are busted, and enters the Fertility Industrial Complex in order to carry her younger lover&#8217;s baby.With the signature sharp wit and wild heart that have made her a favorite to so many readers, Tea guides us through the maze of medical procedures, frustrations and astonishments on the path to getting pregnant, </p>

<p>Summary : For decades, Janet Malcolm?s books and dispatches for the New Yorker and the New York Review of Books poked and prodded at reportorial and biographical convention, gesturing towards the artifice that underpins both public and private selves. In Still Pictures, she turns her gimlet eye on her own life.Beginning with the image of a morose young girl on her way from Prague to New York in 1939, to fitful early loves and her fascination with what it might mean to be a ?bad girl?, Malcolm assembles a composite portrait of a New York childhood, one that never escapes the tug of Europe and the mysteries of fate and family. Later, she delves into the world of William Shawn?s New Yorker and the infamous libel trial that saw her become a character in her own drama.Written with Malcolm?s peerless skill and sharp wit, this memoir from a titan of American letters is unlike any other.</p>

<p>Summary : From the ground, we stand. From our ship, we live. By the stars, we hopeCenturies after the last humans left Earth, the Exodus Fleet is a living relic, a place many are from but few outsiders have seen. Humanity has finally been accepted into the galactic community, but while this has opened doors for many, those who have not yet left for alien cities fear that their carefully cultivated way of life is under threat.Tessa chose to stay home when her brother Ashby left for the stars, but has to question that decision when her position in the Fleet is threatened.Kip, a reluctant young apprentice, itches for change but doesn&#8217;t know where to find it.Sawyer, a lost and lonely newcomer, is just looking for a place to belong.When a disaster rocks this already fragile community, those Exodans who still call the Fleet their home can no longer avoid the inescapable question:What is the purpose of a ship that has reached its destination?</p>

<p>Summary : In this Wampanoag story told in a Native tradition, two kids from the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe learn the story of Wee?chumun (corn) and the first Thanksgiving. The Thanksgiving story that most Americans know celebrates the Pilgrims. But without members of the Wampanoag tribe who already lived on the land where the Pilgrims settled, the Pilgrims would never have made it through their first winter. And without Wee?chumun (corn), the Native people wouldn&#8217;t have helped. An important picture book honoring both the history and tradition that surrounds the story of the first Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Summary : Dostoevsky?s most revolutionary novel, Notes from Underground marks the dividing line between nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction, and between the visions of self each century embodied. One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In complete retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man?s essentially irrational nature.Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Life, like a poem, is a series of choices.?In her memoir You Could Make This Place Beautiful, poet Maggie Smith explores the disintegration of her marriage and her renewed commitment to herself. The book begins with one woman?s personal heartbreak, but its circles widen into a reckoning with contemporary womanhood, traditional gender roles, and the power dynamics that persist even in many progressive homes.

The power of these pieces is cumulative: page after page, they build into a larger interrogation of family, work, and patriarchy.You Could Make This Place Beautiful, like the work of Deborah Levy, Rachel Cusk, and Gina Frangello, is an unflinching look at what it means to live and write our own lives. It is a story about a mother?s fierce and constant love for her children, and a woman?s love and regard for </p>

<p>Summary : Abandoned at ten years old by a mother who wanted to start a new family with her drug-addicted, abusive boyfriend, Danielle was raised by grandparents who thought their child-rearing days had ended in the 1960s. She grew up Black and weird, before weird was cool, in a mostly white neighborhood in upstate New York, which created its own identity crises. Under the eye-rolling, foul-mouthed, loving tutelage of her unapologetic grandmother&#8211;and the horror movies she obsessively watched&#8211;Danielle grew into a tall, awkward, Sassy-loving teenager who wore black eyeliner as lipstick and was struggling with the aftermath of her mother&#8217;s choices. But she also learned that she had the strength and smarts to save herself: her grandmother gifting her a faith in her own capabilities that the world would not have most Black girls believe.</p>

<p>Summary : The last king of America, George III, has been ridiculed as a complete disaster who frittered away the colonies and went mad in his old age. The truth is much more nuanced and fascinating&#8211;and will completely change the way readers and historians view his reign and legacy.Most Americans dismiss George III as a buffoon&#8211;a heartless and terrible monarch with few, if any, redeeming qualities. The best-known modern interpretation of him is Jonathan Groff&#8217;s preening, spitting, and pompous take in Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda&#8217;s Broadway masterpiece. But this deeply unflattering characterization is rooted in the prejudiced and brilliantly persuasive opinions of eighteenth-century revolutionaries like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson, who needed to make the king appear evil in order to achieve their own political aims.

<p>Summary : John Dewey was America&#8217;s greatest public philosopher. A prolific and influential writer for both scholarly and general audiences, he stands out for the remarkable breadth of his contributions. Dewey was a founder of a distinctly American philosophical tradition, pragmatism, and he spoke out widely on the most important questions of his day. He was a progressive thinker whose deep commitment to democracy led him to courageous stances on issues such as war, civil liberties, and racial, class, and gender inequalities.This book gathers the clearest and most powerful of Dewey&#8217;s public writings and shows how they continue to speak to the challenges we face today. An introductory essay and short introductions to each of the texts discuss the current relevance and significance of Dewey&#8217;s work and legacy. The book includes forty-six essays on topics such as democracy in the United States, political power, education, economic justice, science and society, and philosophy and culture. These </p>

<p>Summary : The Book of Five Rings is one of the most insightful texts on the subtle arts of confrontation and victory to emerge from Asian culture. Written not only for martial artists but for anyone who wants to apply the timeless principles of this text to their life, the book analyzes the process of struggle and mastery over conflict that underlies every level of human interaction. The Book of Five Rings was composed in 1643 by the famed duelist and undefeated samurai Miyamoto Musashi. Thomas Cleary&#8217;s translation is immediately accessible, with an introduction that presents the spiritual background of the warrior tradition. Along with Musashi&#8217;s text, Cleary translates here another important Japanese classic on leadership and strategy, The Book of Family Traditions on the Art of War by Yagyu Munenori, which highlights the ethical and spiritual insights of Taoism and Zen as they apply to the way of the warrior.</p>

All told, the trilogy has sold more than a million copies and has secured its place in the pantheon of twenty-first-century literature.And yet for all this, for Jeff VanderMeer there was never full closure to the story of Area X. There were a few mysteries that had gone unsolved, some key points of view never aired. There were stories left to tell.

<p>Summary : The New York Times bestselling author of Get Out of Your Head provides a revolutionary path to embracing a healthy relationship with your emotions, one that leads to life-giving connection with God and others as well as to a richer understanding of yourself.Through personal experience and countless conversations, speaker and Bible teacher Jennie Allen has come to realize that most of us need to unlearn some deeply damaging messages about our emotions. We&#8217;ve been taught, for example, that emotions are untrustworthy when, in fact, they are a gift from God to help us notice what is wrong and where we need to heal. Your emotions are not something to suppress or ignore. They are meant to be felt, examined, and shared.In this transformational look at our inner life through the lens of science and Scripture, Allen shows how, instead of trying to conceal or control our difficult emotions, we can intentionally notice, name, and connect with our feelings in ways that lead to deeper connection </p>

<p>Summary : On pourrait croire qu&#8217;il ne se passe jamais rien d&#8217;extraordinaire ? Chatom, ? part que Mrs Ruffo, l&#8217;institutrice, fume la pipe en classe et regarde avec bienveillance ceux qui font l&#8217;?cole buissonni?re. On pourrait croire que Chatom est un petit village sans myst?res et sans secrets. Et pourtant. Pourtant Stumpy Malone, ancien chercheur d&#8217;or, dispara?t chaque ann?e au mois d&#8217;octobre, sans que personne le voie jamais quitter sa maison. Et c&#8217;est ? Chatom que vient se r?fugier un jour un enfant ?trange, qui risque de perdre la vie, si son identit? est r?v?l?e. Sam Harriott n&#8217;a que quatorze ans, mais il n&#8217;a pas son pareil pour percer un myst?re, ni pour garder un secret. Avec la complicit? d&#8217;Alice, qui n&#8217;a vraiment peur de rien. Et l&#8217;aide pr?cieuse de Mrs Ruffo, qui, d?cid?ment, n&#8217;est pas une institutrice comme les autres.</p>

<p>Summary : On pourrait croire qu&#8217;il ne se passe jamais rien d&#8217;extraordinaire ? Chatom, ? part que Mrs Ruffo, l&#8217;institutrice, fume la pipe en classe et regarde avec bienveillance ceux qui font l&#8217;?cole buissonni?re. On pourrait croire que Chatom est un petit village sans myst?res et sans secrets. Et pourtant. Pourtant Stumpy Malone, ancien chercheur d&#8217;or, dispara?t chaque ann?e au mois d&#8217;octobre, sans que personne le voie jamais quitter sa maison. Et c&#8217;est ? Chatom que vient se r?fugier un jour un enfant ?trange, qui risque de perdre la vie, si son identit? est r?v?l?e. Sam Harriott n&#8217;a que quatorze ans, mais il n&#8217;a pas son pareil pour percer un myst?re, ni pour garder un secret. Avec la complicit? d&#8217;Alice, qui n&#8217;a vraiment peur de rien. Et l&#8217;aide pr?cieuse de Mrs Ruffo, qui, d?cid?ment, n&#8217;est pas une institutrice comme les autres.</p>

<p>Summary : Racial identity, pop culture, and delusions of perfection collide in an eye-opening and refreshingly frank memoir by fashion and beauty insider Danielle Prescod.Danielle Prescod grew up Black in an elite and overwhelmingly white community, her identity made more invisible by the whitewashed movies, television, magazines, and books she and her classmates voraciously consumed. Danielle took her cue from the world around her and aspired to shrink her identity into that box, setting increasingly poisonous goals. She started painful and damaging chemical hair treatments in elementary school, began depriving herself of food when puberty hit, and tried to control her image through the most unimpeachable, impeccable fashion choices.Those obsessions led her to relentlessly pursue a career in beauty and fashion?the eye of the racist and sexist beauty standard storm.

<p>Summary : Real men fought for our freedoms. It?s time we fought for theirs.Pete Hegseth joined the Army to fight extremists. Then that same Army called him one. The military Pete joined twenty years ago was fiercely focused on lethality, competency, and color blindness. Today our brass are following the rest of our country off the cliff of cultural chaos and weakness.Americans with common sense are fighting this on many fronts, but if we can?t save the meritocracy of our military, we?re definitely going to lose everywhere else.The War on Warriors uncovers the deep roots of our dysfunction?a society that has forgotten the men who take risks, cut through red tape, and get their hands dirty. The only kind of men prepared to face the dan?gers that the Left pretends don?t exist. Unlike issues of education or taxes or crime, this problem doesn?t have a zip code solution. We can?t move away from it. We can?t avoid it. We have only one Pentagon. Either we take it back or surrender it </p>

<p>Summary : Conflict is an inevitable part of life, according to this ancient Chinese classic of strategy, but everything necessary to deal with conflict wisely, honorably, victoriously, is already present within us. Compiled more than two thousand years ago by a mysterious warrior-philosopher, The Art of War  is still perhaps the most prestigious and influential book of strategy in the world, as eagerly studied in Asia by modern politicians and executives as it has been by military leaders since ancient times. As a study of the anatomy of organizations in conflict, The Art of War  applies to competition and conflict in general, on every level from the interpersonal to the international. Its aim is invincibility, victory without battle, and unassailable strength through understanding the physics, politics, and psychology of conflict.(Original publish date was circa 500 BCE.)</p>

<p>Summary : Conflict is an inevitable part of life, according to this ancient Chinese classic of strategy, but everything necessary to deal with conflict wisely, honorably, victoriously, is already present within us. Compiled more than two thousand years ago by a mysterious warrior-philosopher, The Art of War  is still perhaps the most prestigious and influential book of strategy in the world, as eagerly studied in Asia by modern politicians and executives as it has been by military leaders since ancient times. As a study of the anatomy of organizations in conflict, The Art of War  applies to competition and conflict in general, on every level from the interpersonal to the international. Its aim is invincibility, victory without battle, and unassailable strength through understanding the physics, politics, and psychology of conflict.(Original publish date was circa 500 BCE.)</p>

Pour d?obscures raisons, Vorn, qui a pris la rel?ve du bienveillant professeur Balzar se lance ? la poursuite de cette b?te f?roce.

<p>Summary : Cuando al final de la d?cada de los sesenta la narrativa hispanoamericana alcanz? un prestigio mundial, se volvi? la vista atr?s en busca de sus &#8220;cl?sicos&#8221;, momento en el que la figura gigantesca de Rulfo destac? inmediatamente. En 1955 aparece &#8220;Pedro P?ramo&#8221;, novela gestada largamente por un escritor con fama de poco prol?fico y que aun? la propia tradici?n narrativa hispanoamericana con las t?cnicas de los principales renovadores de la occidental: Joyce, Faulkner, Woolf&#8230; Rico y apasionante como pocos, el relato de la historia de Comala y de sus malogrados habitantes arrastra a los lectores del desconcierto a la sugesti?n, sumergi?ndolos en una sucesi?n de cuadros l?ricos en la que los personajes, los paisajes y el lenguaje mismo parecen cobrar vida.</p>

<p>Summary : Cuando al final de la d?cada de los sesenta la narrativa hispanoamericana alcanz? un prestigio mundial, se volvi? la vista atr?s en busca de sus &#8220;cl?sicos&#8221;, momento en el que la figura gigantesca de Rulfo destac? inmediatamente. En 1955 aparece &#8220;Pedro P?ramo&#8221;, novela gestada largamente por un escritor con fama de poco prol?fico y que aun? la propia tradici?n narrativa hispanoamericana con las t?cnicas de los principales renovadores de la occidental: Joyce, Faulkner, Woolf&#8230; Rico y apasionante como pocos, el relato de la historia de Comala y de sus malogrados habitantes arrastra a los lectores del desconcierto a la sugesti?n, sumergi?ndolos en una sucesi?n de cuadros l?ricos en la que los personajes, los paisajes y el lenguaje mismo parecen cobrar vida.</p>

<p>Summary : Two sisters raised in fear are about to find out why in a chilling novel of psychological suspense from the author of The Thinnest Air.Ignorant of civilization and cautioned against its evils, nineteen-year-old Wren and her two sisters, Sage and Evie, were raised in off-the-grid isolation in a primitive cabin in upstate New York. When the youngest grows gravely ill, their mother leaves with the child to get help from a nearby town. And they never return.As months pass, hope vanishes. Supplies are low. Livestock are dying. A brutal winter is bearing down. Then comes the stranger. He claims to be looking for the girls? mother, and he?s not leaving without them.To escape, Wren and her sister must break the rule they?ve grown up with: never go beyond the forest.Past the thicket of dread, they come upon a house on the other side of the pines. This is where Wren and Sage must confront something more chilling than the unknowable. They?ll discover what?s been hidden from them, what they?re </p>

<p>Summary : 1992. Eight respectable, upstanding people have been found dead across the US. These deaths look like accidents and don&#8217;t appear to be connected. Until one body &#8211; the victim of a fatal fall from a hospital window &#8211; generates some unexpected attention.That attention comes from the Secretary of Defence, who promptly calls for an inter-agency task force to investigate. Jack Reacher is assigned as the Army&#8217;s representative.Reacher may be an exceptional soldier, but sweeping other people&#8217;s secrets under the carpet isn&#8217;t part of his skill set. As he races to discover the link between these victims, and who killed them, he must navigate around the ulterior motives of his new &#8216;partners&#8217;. And all while moving into the sight line of some of the most dangerous people he has ever encountered.His mission is to uncover the truth. The question is: will Reacher bring the bad guys to justice the official way . . . or his way?</p>

<p>Summary : A timely investigation into the campus assault on free speech and what it means for students, education, and our democracy.The generation now coming of age has been taught three Great Untruths: their feelings are always right; they should avoid pain and discomfort; and they should look for faults in others and not themselves. These three Great Untruths are part of a larger philosophy that sees young people as fragile creatures who must be protected and supervised by adults. But despite the good intentions of the adults who impart them, the Great Untruths are harming kids by teaching them the opposite of ancient wisdom and the opposite of modern psychological findings on grit, growth, and antifragility. The result is rising rates of depression and anxiety, along with endless stories of college campuses torn apart by moralistic divisions and mutual recriminations. This is a book about how we got here. First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt take us </p>

<p>Summary : A stunning investigation of the life and legend of Mexican kingpin Joaqu?n Archivaldo &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzm?n Loera, building on Noah Hurowitz&#8217;s revelatory coverage for Rolling Stone of El Chapo&#8217;s federal drug-trafficking trial.This is the true story of how El Chapo built the world&#8217;s wealthiest and most powerful drug-trafficking operation, based on months&#8217; worth of trial testimony and dozens of interviews with cartel gunmen, Mexican journalists and political figures, Chapo&#8217;s family members, and the DEA agents who brought him down. Over the course of three decades, El Chapo was responsible for smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, meth, and fentanyl around the world, becoming in the process the most celebrated and reviled drug lord since Pablo Escobar. El Chapo waged ruthless wars against his rivals and former allies, plunging vast areas of Mexico into unprecedented levels of violence, even as many in his home state of Sinaloa continued to view him as a hero.

<p>Summary : A stunning investigation of the life and legend of Mexican kingpin Joaqu?n Archivaldo &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzm?n Loera, building on Noah Hurowitz&#8217;s revelatory coverage for Rolling Stone of El Chapo&#8217;s federal drug-trafficking trial.This is the true story of how El Chapo built the world&#8217;s wealthiest and most powerful drug-trafficking operation, based on months&#8217; worth of trial testimony and dozens of interviews with cartel gunmen, Mexican journalists and political figures, Chapo&#8217;s family members, and the DEA agents who brought him down. Over the course of three decades, El Chapo was responsible for smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, meth, and fentanyl around the world, becoming in the process the most celebrated and reviled drug lord since Pablo Escobar. El Chapo waged ruthless wars against his rivals and former allies, plunging vast areas of Mexico into unprecedented levels of violence, even as many in his home state of Sinaloa continued to view him as a hero.

<p>Summary : 8 hours, 46 minutes The raw, candid, unvarnished memoir of an American icon. The greatest movie star of the past 75 years covers everything: his traumatic childhood, his career, his drinking, his thoughts on Marlon Brando, James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, John Huston, his greatest roles, acting, his intimate life with Joanne Woodward, his innermost fears and passions and joys. With thoughts/comments throughout from Joanne Woodward, George Roy Hill, Tom Cruise, Elia Kazan and many others.In 1986, Paul Newman and his closest friend, screenwriter Stewart Stern, began an extraordinary project.

<p>Summary : A brutally honest and moving memoir of lust, abuse, addiction, stardom, and redemption from Arrow and Teen Wolf actor Colton Haynes. Four years ago, Colton Haynes woke up in a hospital. He?d had two seizures, lost the sight in one eye, almost ruptured a kidney, and been put on an involuntary psychiatry hold. Not yet thirty, he knew he had to take stock of his life and make some serious changes if he wanted to see his next birthday. As he worked towards sobriety, Haynes allowed himself to become vulnerable for the first time in years and with that, discovered profound self-awareness. He had millions of social media followers who constantly told him they loved him. But what would they think if they knew his true story? If they knew where he came from and the things he had done? Now, Colton bravely pulls back the curtain on his life and career, revealing the incredible highs and devastating lows. From his unorthodox childhood in a small Kansas town, to coming to terms with his </p>

<p>Summary : How states are making their legal systems more equitable, seen through the story of a Black man falsely imprisoned for thirty years for murder.In 1987, Ben Spencer, a twenty-two-year-old Black man from Dallas, was convicted of murdering white businessman Jeffrey Young?a crime he didn?t commit. From the day of his arrest, Spencer insisted that it was ?an awful mistake.? The Texas legal system didn?t see it that way.

It doesn?t take much&#8211;just hearing of someone else?s accomplishments, being criticized, getting into an argument, making a mistake at work&#8211;to make us feel that we are not okay. Beginning to understand how our lives have become ensnared in this trance of unworthiness is our first step toward reconnecting with who we really are and what it means to live fully. &#8211;from Radical AcceptanceRadical Acceptance?Believing that something is wrong with us is a deep and tenacious suffering,? says Tara Brach at the start of this illuminating book. This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork&#8211;all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach?s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist </p>

<p>Summary : A daughter returns home to the Navajo reservation to confront her family&#8217;s troubled history and retrace her mother&#8217;s life?using both narrative and archive in this unforgettable and heart-wrenching memoir.After Danielle Geller&#8217;s mother dies of a withdrawal from alcohol during a period of homelessness, she is forced to return to Florida. Using her training as a librarian and archivist, Geller collects her mother&#8217;s documents, diaries, and photographs into a single suitcase and begins on a journey of confronting her family&#8217;s history and the decisions she&#8217;s been forced to make, a journey that will end at her mother&#8217;s home: the Navajo reservation. Geller masterfully intertwines wrenching prose with archival documents to create a deeply moving narrative of loss and inheritance that pays homage to our pasts, traditions, heritage, the family we are given, and the family we choose.</p>

<p>Summary : As Weissman once said?&#8221;&#8230;can we please stop with the barrage of 2.3 second meals that only need 1 ingredient? I get it? we?re busy. But let?s refocus on the fact that beautifully crafted burgers don&#8217;t grow on trees.&#8221; Ironically this sounds a lot like he&#8217;s trying to convince you to cook, but he&#8217;s really not. Is this selling the cookbook? The point is that the food in this book is an invitation that speaks for itself. Great cooking does, and should, take time. Now is the time to double down and get your head in the cooking game. Or you know, don&#8217;t. Maybe get someone else to cook this stuff for you&#8230;that works too.

<p>Summary : JuniperAfter a cult tried to sacrifice me to their wicked God, I went on the run, doing whatever was necessary to survive. Until a demon offered me a deal: give him my soul and he&#8217;ll help me claim the vengeance I seek. Blood will be spilled, and the monsters I once ran from will soon be running from me. But damning my soul was just the beginning &#8211; it&#8217;s my heart the demon wants next.ZaneI&#8217;ve been hunting souls for centuries, but she&#8217;s the ultimate prize &#8211; vicious and feral, with a broken soul as dark as my own. I thought claiming her would be a simple game, but Juniper is far from simple. I chose to follow her on a path drenched with the blood of her enemies, but it&#8217;s our blood that may be spilled next. As an ancient God wakes from Its slumber, neither of us may survive.Her Soul for Revenge is book 2 in the Souls Trilogy. Although all the books are interconnected, they are stand-alone and can be read in any order.Content NoteThis book contains sexual scenes, kink/fetish content, </p>

<p>Summary : Heralded as an instant classic of fantasy literature, Maguire has written a wonderfully imaginative retelling of The Wizard of Oz told from the Wicked Witch&#8217;s point of view. More than just a fairy tale for adults, Wicked is a meditation on the nature of good and evil.Elphaba is born with green skin, a precocious mind, and a talent for magic. An outcast throughout her childhood in Munchkinland, she finally begins to feel as though she fits in when she enters the University in the Emerald City. While she hones her skills, she discovers that Oz isn&#8217;t the Utopia it seems. She sets out to protect its unwanted creatures, becoming known as the Wicked Witch along the way.Narrator John McDonough draws you in to Maguire&#8217;s magical world of witches and talking animals, making it possible to believe in a land somewhere over the rainbow.</p>
