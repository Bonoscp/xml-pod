<p>Summary : Our narrator?s days are numbered. Estranged from his family, living alone with only his cat Cabbage for company, he was unprepared for the doctor?s diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can set about tackling his bucket list, the Devil appears with a special offer: in exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, he can have one extra day of life. And so begins a very bizarre week . . .Because how do you decide what makes life worth living? How do you separate out what you can do without from what you hold dear? In dealing with the Devil our narrator will take himself ? and his beloved cat ? to the brink. Genki Kawamura&#8217;s If Cats Disappeared from the World is a story of loss and reconciliation, of one man?s journey to discover what really matters in modern life.This beautiful tale is translated from the Japanese by Eric Selland, who also translated The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide. Fans of The Guest Cat and The Travelling Cat Chronicles will also surely </p>

<p>Summary : In this comic adventure through the loneliness epidemic, a middle-aged everyman looks around one day and realizes that he seems to have misplaced his friends, inspiring him to set out on a hilarious and ultimately moving quest to revive old tribes and build new ones, in his own ridiculous way.At the age of forty, having settled into his busy career and active family life, Billy Baker discovers that he?s lost something crucial along the way: his friends. Other priorities always seemed to come first, until all his close friendships had lapsed into distant memories. When he takes an assignment to write an article about the modern loneliness epidemic, he realizes just how common it is to be a middle-aged loner: almost fifty million Americans over the age of forty-five, especially men, suffer from chronic loneliness, which the surgeon general has declared one of the nation?s ?greatest pathologies,? worse than smoking, obesity, or heart disease in increasing a person?s risk for premature </p>

<p>Summary : Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.</p>

<p>Summary : The sword, saber, and staff weapons of Taijiquan are implements for improving your health, expressing qi, and issuing intrinsic energy (jin). Even though these three weapons are complete training systems of Taijiquan within themselves, each has a primary focus in its practice: Sword develops the skill of extending intrinsic energy through the arms and hands. The handling of the sword is likened to the skills of a Chinese calligrapher with a writing brush, making use of very refined yin and yang movements. Saber develops the skill of issuing qi from the spine. The handling of the saber is equated to the skills of a Chinese archer pulling a bow, making use of movements for drawing-in and releasing energy. Staff develops the skill of directing intrinsic energy through the waist. The wielding of the staff relates to the skills of a Chinese fisherman poling a boat across the water, moving the entire body as one unit with steady, relaxed, and flowing motions. All practicers of Taijiquan </p>

Forty years later, Lowman remains one of the world?s foremost arbornauts, known as the ?real-life Lorax.?

So she put together a climbing kit: she sewed a harness from an old seat belt, gathered hundreds of feet of rope, and found a tool belt for her pencils and rulers. Up she went, into the trees. Forty years later, Lowman remains one of the world?s foremost arbornauts, known as the ?real-life Lorax.? She planned one of the first treetop walkways and helps create more of these bridges through the eighth continent all over the world.With a voice as infectious in its enthusiasm as it is practical in its optimism, The Arbornaut chronicles </p>

<p>Summary : Dark secrets from the past bob to the surface in the third novella in the Widow?s Island series.When a body washes up on the state park beach, Deputy Tessa Black?s experience as a former Seattle detective tells her that the death was not an accident. All evidence points to another murder on the remote island.The victim is a local contractor with a shockingly long list of enemies. The more locals Tessa interviews, the more people she suspects?from the bitter ex-wife and estranged current wife to disgruntled former clients and employees. They all have different reasons to want him dead.As Tessa?s investigation heats up, arson and a vicious assault convince her the killer is desperate to hide his crime?and that she?d better solve the case before he claims another victim.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  This is an updated cover of this Kindle edition. <br />
In a shadowy antiques shop in Rome, violinist Julia Ansdell happens upon a curious piece of music?the Incendio waltz?and is immediately entranced by its unusual composition. Full of passion, torment, and chilling beauty, and seemingly unknown to the world, the waltz, its mournful minor key, its feverish arpeggios, appear to dance with a strange life of their own. Julia is determined to master the complex work and make its melody heard.  Back home in Boston, from the moment Julia?s bow moves across the strings, drawing the waltz?s fiery notes into the air, something strange is stirred?and Julia?s world comes under threat. The music has a terrifying and inexplicable effect on her young daughter, who seems violently transformed. Convinced that the hypnotic strains of Incendio are weaving a malevolent spell, Julia sets out to discover the man and the meaning behind the score.  Her quest beckons Julia to the ancient city of Venice, where </p>

<p>Summary : It&#8217;s a perfect world, where everything looks right. But ugly truths lie beneath the surface! It is the future. There is no war, no hunger, no pain. No one in The Community wants for anything. Everyone is provided for. Each Family Unit is entitled to one female and male child. Each member of The Community has their profession carefully chosen for them by the Committee of Elders, and they never make a mistake. Jonas, a sensitive twelve-year-old boy, had never thought there was anything wrong with his Community, until one day. From the moment Jonas is selected as the Receiver of Memory at The Ceremony, his life is never the same. Jonas discovers that The Community is not as perfect as it seems. Although they appear to have everything, they are missing something of great importance. It is up to Jonas, with the help of the Giver, to find what long ago had been lost. And so Jonas embarks on an adventure to save the world as he knows it. Simply and beautifully written, The Giver is sure to </p>

<p>Summary : From the author of the critically acclaimed and globally successful The Phantom Atlas, The Golden Atlas and The Sky Atlas comes a stunning new work. The Madman?s Library is a unique, beautifully illustrated journey through the entire history of literature, delving into its darkest territories to hunt down the very strangest books ever written, and uncover the fascinating stories behind their creation.This is a madman?s library of eccentric and extraordinary volumes from around the world, many of which have been completely forgotten. Books written in blood and books that kill, books of the insane and books that hoaxed the globe, books invisible to the naked eye and books so long they could destroy the Universe, books worn into battle, books of code and cypher whose secrets remain undiscovered? and a few others that are just plain weird.From the 605-page Qur&#8217;an written in the blood of Saddam Hussein, through the gorgeously decorated 15th-century lawsuit filed by the Devil against </p>

<p>Summary : From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an intimate and charming memoir of life in and out of the kitchen.Before Stanley Tucci became a household name with The Devil Wears Prada, The Hunger Games, and the perfect Negroni, he grew up in an Italian American family that spent every night around the table. He shared the magic of those meals with us in The Tucci Cookbook and The Tucci Table, and now he takes us beyond the recipes and into the stories behind them.Taste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with anecdotes about growing up in Westchester, New York, preparing for and filming the foodie films Big Night and Julie &amp; Julia, falling in love over dinner, and teaming up with his wife to create conversation-starting meals for their children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and burnt dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.Written with Stanley&#8217;s signature wry humour and </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don&#8217;t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.&#8221;Dr. Seuss&#8217;s small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His &#8220;wonderful, awful&#8221; idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos&#8217; presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  The noted inventor and futurist&#8217;s successor to his landmark book </p>
<p>    The Singularity Is Near</p>
<p>   explores how technology will refashion the human race in the decades to come <br />
Since it was first published in 2005, Ray Kurzweil&#8217;s The Singularity Is Near and its vision of the future have been influential in spawning a worldwide movement with millions of followers, hundreds of books, major films (Her, Lucy, Ex Machina), and thousands of articles. During the succeeding decade many of Kurzweil&#8217;s predictions about technological advancements have been borne out, and their viability has become familiar to the public through such now commonplace concepts as AI, intelligent machines, and bioengineering.In this entirely new book Ray Kurzweil brings a fresh perspective to advances in the singularity&#8211;assessing the progress of many of his predictions and examining the novel advancements that, in the near future, will bring a revolution in knowledge and an expansion of human potential. </p>

<p>Summary : Bestselling, Scotiabank Giller Award-winning writer Ian Williams brings fresh eyes and new insights to today&#8217;s urgent conversation on race and racism in startling, illuminating essays that grow out of his own experience as a Black man moving through the world. With that one eloquent word, disorientation, Ian Williams captures the impact of racial encounters on racialized people&#8211;the whiplash of race that occurs while minding one&#8217;s own business. Sometimes the consequences are only irritating, but sometimes they are deadly. Spurred by the police killings and street protests of 2020, Williams realized he could offer a perspective distinct from the almost exclusively America-centric books on race topping the bestseller lists, because of one salient fact: he has lived in Trinidad (where he was never the only Black person in the room), in Canada (where he often was), and in the United States (where as a Black man from the Caribbean, he was a different kind of only).Inspired by the essays </p>

Detalhe: o organizador da sangrenta disputa ? o pr?prio Estado japon?s, imaginado pelo autor como uma totalit?ria Rep?blica da Grande ?sia Oriental.O livro, intitulado Battle Royale, s? seria lan?ado em 1999, espalhando um rastro de pol?mica ? vendeu mais de 1 milh?o de exemplares e foi comentado no Jap?o inteiro. A repercuss?o foi t?o intensa que apenas um ano depois j? eram lan?adas as adapta??es da hist?ria para o cinema e para os mang?s ? mais tarde, viriam sequ?ncias tanto na tela grande </p>

<p>Summary : Love wasn?t the daily special when a grumpy small-town baker delivers a baby in his bakery. Now, all he can think about is that sweet bundle and her tempting single mother.Having a baby in a bakery gives new meaning to taking the bun out of the oven. I?d been in Curmudgeon Bakery for one of those lemon baby-Bundt cakes I?d been craving since I found out I was pregnant. The draw had nothing to do with the baker himself. Tall, tatted, and edgy, looking more like a biker than a man who makes baked goods. I hardly knew him other than taking a tumble in a rainstorm in front of his shop . . . and then tossing myself at him after he rescued me. We shared a moment but it?s not what you?d think. Months later, he delivered my baby among his cookies and cakes. Talk about a second chance encounter. Then he whips up a plan to pretend to be my baby?s father, and everything heats up from there.

<p>Summary : Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords? In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.</p>

<p>Summary : A simple sting operation takes a violent and unexpected turn for Detective Eve Ronin in a gripping thriller by #1 New York Times bestselling author Lee Goldberg.Los Angeles County Sheriff?s detective Eve Ronin and her soon-to-retire partner, Duncan Pavone, are running a 24-7 sting in a guard-gated enclave of palatial homes in Calabasas. Their luxury McMansion is a honey trap, set to lure in the violent home invaders terrorizing the community. The trap works, leaving three intruders dead, a body count that nearly includes Eve and Duncan.Eve?s bosses are eager to declare the case closed, but there are too many unanswered questions for her to let go. Was the trap actually for her, bloody payback for Eve?s very public takedown of a clique of corrupt deputies? Or is there an even deadlier secret lurking behind those opulent gates? Eve?s refusal to back down and her relentless quest for the truth make her both the hunter?and the prey.</p>

<p>Summary : An Amazon #1 Best-Seller! Named the #1 Soccer Book by Football.com. Named a Top 5 Book of the Year by the NSCAA Soccer Journal! Soccer iQ is the first book for soccer PLAYERS! In a world saturated with books about how to coach soccer, Dan Blank finally gives players a book on how to think it.

Written in plain-spoken language, Soccer IQ is an easy read and a quick-fix to the most common yet critically </p>

After a series of costly setbacks, the commandant faced two bad turn back in defeat and spare his men the devastating Antarctic winter, or recklessly chase fame by sailing deeper into the freezing waters.

<p>Summary : No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you&#8217;re not breathing properly.There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat 25,000 times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren&#8217;t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of S?o Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can </p>

<p>Summary : Oggi, un apprezzato accademico come Alessandro Barbero ripropone una traduzione di questi godibilissimi poemetti distaccandosi dal tradizionale approccio filologico. I fabliaux, infatti, sono tutti scritti in versi, in lingua d?oil, e come tali tradotti in francese moderno. L?operazione che qui si ? voluta tentare, con lusinghieri risultati, ? stata quella di riproporre la loro freschezza ed immediatezza ad un pubblico pi? vasto, avvezzo alla lettura in prosa come ? quello contemporaneo. Ne ? risultata una traduzione pi? libera, ma assai pi? fruibile, che rivela storie piccanti, vivaci e sarcastiche, proprie di una mentalit? medievale acuta e dissacratoria, ai pi? ? del tutto sconosciuta e insospettata.</p>

<p>Summary : Featuring a new introduction by the author, Angela Davis: An Autobiography is a classic account of a life in struggle.Angela Davis has been a political activist at the cutting edge of the Black Liberation, feminist, queer, and prison abolitionist movements for more than 50 years. First published and edited by Toni Morrison in 1974, An Autobiography is a powerful and commanding account of her early years in struggle. Davis describes her journey from a childhood on Dynamite Hill in Birmingham, Alabama, to one of the most significant political trials of the century: from her political activity in a New York high school to her work with the U.S. Communist Party, the Black Panther Party, and the Soledad Brothers; and from the faculty of the Philosophy Department at UCLA to the FBI&#8217;s list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Told with warmth, brilliance, humor and conviction, Angela Davis?s autobiography is a classic account of a life in struggle with echoes in our own time.</p>

<p>Summary : The first biography of the dazzling and painful life of Nobel Prize?winning physicist Roger Penrose As a little boy, Roger Penrose and his father discovered a sundial in a clearing behind their home. In that machine made of light, shadow, and time, six-year-old Roger discovered a ?world behind the world? of transcendently beautiful geometry, beginning a journey toward becoming one of the world?s most influential mathematicians, philosophers, and physicists.In the years to come, Penrose earned a Nobel Prize, a knighthood, and dozens of other prestigious honors. He proved the limitations of general relativity, and he set a new agenda for theoretical physics. However, as Patchen Barss documents in The Impossible Man, success came at a price. Penrose?s longing for knowledge was matched only by his inability to understand those around him, and he struggled to connect with friends, family, and especially the women in his life. His final years have been spent alone with his research, </p>

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Os efeitos colaterais do discurso motivacional O mercado de palestras e livros motivacionais est? crescendo desde o in?cio do s?culo XXI e n?o mostra sinais de desaquecimento. Religi?es tradicionais est?o perdendo adeptos para novas igrejas que trocam o discurso do pecado pelo encorajamento e autoajuda. As institui??es pol?ticas e empresariais mudaram o sistema de puni??o, hierarquia e combate ao concorrente pelas positividades do est?mulo, efici?ncia e reconhecimento social pela supera??o das pr?prias limita??es. Byung-Chul Han mostra que a sociedade disciplinar e repressora do s?culo XX descrita por Michel Foucault perde espa?o para uma nova forma de organiza??o coercitiva: a viol?ncia neuronal. As pessoas se cobram cada vez mais para apresentar resultados &#8211; tornando elas mesmas vigilantes e carrascas de suas a??es.

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Os efeitos colaterais do discurso motivacional O mercado de palestras e livros motivacionais est? crescendo desde o in?cio do s?culo XXI e n?o mostra sinais de desaquecimento. Religi?es tradicionais est?o perdendo adeptos para novas igrejas que trocam o discurso do pecado pelo encorajamento e autoajuda. As institui??es pol?ticas e empresariais mudaram o sistema de puni??o, hierarquia e combate ao concorrente pelas positividades do est?mulo, efici?ncia e reconhecimento social pela supera??o das pr?prias limita??es. Byung-Chul Han mostra que a sociedade disciplinar e repressora do s?culo XX descrita por Michel Foucault perde espa?o para uma nova forma de organiza??o coercitiva: a viol?ncia neuronal. As pessoas se cobram cada vez mais para apresentar resultados &#8211; tornando elas mesmas vigilantes e carrascas de suas a??es.

<p>Summary : Real men fought for our freedoms. It?s time we fought for theirs.Pete Hegseth joined the Army to fight extremists. Then that same Army called him one. The military Pete joined twenty years ago was fiercely focused on lethality, competency, and color blindness. Today our brass are following the rest of our country off the cliff of cultural chaos and weakness.Americans with common sense are fighting this on many fronts, but if we can?t save the meritocracy of our military, we?re definitely going to lose everywhere else.The War on Warriors uncovers the deep roots of our dysfunction?a society that has forgotten the men who take risks, cut through red tape, and get their hands dirty. The only kind of men prepared to face the dan?gers that the Left pretends don?t exist. Unlike issues of education or taxes or crime, this problem doesn?t have a zip code solution. We can?t move away from it. We can?t avoid it. We have only one Pentagon. Either we take it back or surrender it </p>

<p>Summary : The first book in Bernard Cornwell&#8217;s epic Sharpe series, which completely transports the reader to an unforgettable time and place in history.At Talavera in July of 1809, Captain Richard Sharpe, bold, professional, and ruthless, prepares to lead his men against the armies of Napoleon into what will be the bloodiest battle of the war. Sharpe has earned his captaincy, but there are others, such as the foppish Lieutenant Gibbons and his uncle, Colonel Henry Simmerson, who have bought their commissions despite their incompetence.After their cowardly loss of the regiment&#8217;s colors, their resentment toward the upstart Sharpe turns to treachery, and Sharpe must battle his way through sword fights and bloody warfare to redeem the honor of his regiment by capturing the most valued prize in the French Army?a golden Imperial Eagle, the standard touched by the hand of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>Summary : The first book in Bernard Cornwell&#8217;s epic Sharpe series, which completely transports the reader to an unforgettable time and place in history.At Talavera in July of 1809, Captain Richard Sharpe, bold, professional, and ruthless, prepares to lead his men against the armies of Napoleon into what will be the bloodiest battle of the war. Sharpe has earned his captaincy, but there are others, such as the foppish Lieutenant Gibbons and his uncle, Colonel Henry Simmerson, who have bought their commissions despite their incompetence.After their cowardly loss of the regiment&#8217;s colors, their resentment toward the upstart Sharpe turns to treachery, and Sharpe must battle his way through sword fights and bloody warfare to redeem the honor of his regiment by capturing the most valued prize in the French Army?a golden Imperial Eagle, the standard touched by the hand of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>Summary : New mother Lady Georgiana &#8220;Georgie&#8221; Rannoch finds herself trying to separate fact from fiction when a murder occurs while a film is being made on the grounds of her estate in a new Royal Spyness Mystery from beloved bestselling author Rhys Bowen.It&#8217;s late 1936, and King Edward is in turmoil, having fallen in love with the scandalously divorced and even more scandalously American Wallis Simpson. He wants to marry her but knows that doing so will jeopardize his crown. Edward confides in his dear friend Darcy, Georgie&#8217;s husband, and the couple agree to hide Wallis in their home while Edward figures out what to do. But unbeknownst to Georgie and Darcy, Sir Hubert, the owner of the estate, has given a film crew permission to shoot a motion picture about Henry the Eighth and Anne Boleyn on the grounds. Trying to keep Mrs. Simpson hidden while raising a newborn baby seems like it couldn&#8217;t be any more stressful for the Rannochs, until one of the stars of the film is found murdered on set. </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  ?Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us. She shows us their strangeness; discerning, sure-footed, challenging our values, piquing our curiosity, she leads us through an alien landscape that moves and delights us.??Hilary Mantel <br />
The Persian Boy centers on the most tempestuous years of Alexander the Great?s life, as seen through the eyes of his lover and most faithful attendant, Bagoas.When Bagoas is very young, his father is murdered and he is sold as a slave to King Darius of Persia. Then, when Alexander conquers the land, he is given Bagoas as a gift, and the boy is besotted.

Now, with Cinema Speculation, the time has come, and the results are everything his passionate fans?and all movie lovers?could have hoped for. Organized around key American films from the 1970s, all of which he first saw as a young moviegoer at the time, this book is as intellectually rigorous and insightful as it is rollicking and entertaining. At once film criticism, film theory, a feat of reporting, and wonderful personal history, it is all written in the singular voice recognizable immediately as QT?s and </p>

<p>Summary : The Psychology of Money&#8217; Tamil Edition. TIMELESS LESSONS ON WEALTH, GREED, AND HAPPINESS Doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters.</p>

<p>Summary : ?ifreli yaz?lar?m? tuttu?um hat?ra defterimi ve ilk ?iirlerimi Macaristan?da b?rakt?m. Erkek karde?lerimi, annemi babam?, haber bile vermeden, bir veda bile etmeden geride b?rakt?m. Ama hepsinden de ?nemlisi o g?n, 1956?n?n o Kas?m sonu, bir halka olan aidiyetimi kesin olarak kaybettim. Macaristan?daki ilk mutlu y?llar, sava? sonras? yoksulluk, yat?l? okul d?nemi, ??ocuklu?un g?m?? ipli?i?nin kopu?u, Stalin?in ?l?m?, s?rg?n, Lozan y?llar?, yeni bir ?lke, anadil ve d??man dil&#8230; ?gota Krist?f bebe?i ve kocas?yla yirmi bir ya??nda s???nmac? olarak yerle?ti?i ?svi?re?de hi?bir zaman tam anlam?yla h?kim olamayaca??, asla kendine ait k?lamayaca??, ne yazabildi?i ne de okuyabildi?i d??man bir dille tan???r. Bundan b?yle kendini bir halk?n par?as? hissedemedi?i gibi ?tekilik hissini de her daim i?inde ta??r. Yazar?n tek otobiyografik metni olan Okumaz Yazmaz ?l??l?, k?sa c?mleleri, ne eksik ne de fazla s?zc?kleriyle do?rudan okurun kalbine sesleniyor. ?Bu kitap k???k bir m?cevher.?Kirkus </p>

<p>Summary : An affectionate and engaging history of the American bookstore and its central place in American cultural life, from department stores to indies, from highbrow dealers trading in first editions to sidewalk vendors, and from chains to special-interest community destinationsBookstores have always been unlike any other kind of store, shaping readers and writers, and influencing our tastes, thoughts, and politics. They nurture local communities while creating new ones of their own. Bookshops are powerful spaces, but they are also endangered ones. In The Bookshop, we see those stakes: what has been, and what might be lost.Evan Friss?s history of the bookshop draws on oral histories, archival collections, municipal records, diaries, letters, and interviews with leading booksellers to offer a fascinating look at this institution beloved by so many. The story begins with Benjamin Franklin?s first bookstore in Philadelphia and takes us to a range of booksellers including The Strand, Chicago?s </p>
