<p>Summary : Researcher and thought leader Dr. Bren? Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives.?It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.? ?Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In </p>

<p>Summary : From Montana Poet Laureate Chris La Tray, a singular story of discovery and embrace of Indigenous identity.Growing up in Western Montana, Chris La Tray always identified as Indian. While the representation of Indigenous people was mostly limited to racist depictions in toys and television shows, and despite the fact that his father fiercely denied any connection, he found Indians alluring, often recalling his grandmother?s consistent mention of their Chippewa heritage.When La Tray attended his grandfather?s funeral as a young man, he finally found himself surrounded by relatives who obviously were Indigenous. ?Who were they?? he wondered. ?Why didn?t I know them? Why was I never allowed to know them?? Catalyzed by the death of his father two decades later, La Tray embarks on a sprawling investigation. He takes a DNA test, which offers the first key clue to his heritage: a family tree. He scours the archives of used bookstores, interviews family, and travels to powwows, book fairs, </p>

<p>Summary : From internationally renowned writer and Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, a searing, deeply personal account of enduring?and surviving?an attempt on his life thirty years after the fatwa that was ordered against him On the morning of August 12, 2022, Salman Rushdie was standing onstage at the Chautauqua Institution, preparing to give a lecture on the importance of keeping writers safe from harm, when a man in black?black clothes, black mask?rushed down the aisle toward him, wielding a knife. His first thought: So it?s you. Here you are.What followed was a horrific act of violence that shook the literary world and beyond. Now, for the first time, and in unforgettable detail, Rushdie relives the traumatic events of that day and its aftermath, as well as his journey toward physical recovery and the healing that was made possible by the love and support of his wife, Eliza, his family, his army of doctors and physical therapists, and his community of readers worldwide.Knife is Rushdie </p>

<p>Summary : Part of Penguin&#8217;s beautiful hardback Clothbound Classics series, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith, these delectable and collectible editions are bound in high-quality colourful, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design. In The Canterbury Tales Chaucer created one of the great touchstones of English literature, a masterly collection of chivalric romances, moral allegories and low farce. A story-telling competition between a group of pilgrims from all walks of life is the occasion for a series of tales that range from the Knight&#8217;s account of courtly love and the ebullient Wife of Bath&#8217;s Arthurian legend, to the ribald anecdotes of the Miller and the Cook.</p>

<p>Summary : A potent exploration of the power of blockchains to reshape the future of the internet?and how that affects us all?from influential technology entrepreneur and startup investor Chris DixonThe internet of today is a far cry from its early promise of a decentralized, democratic network of innovation, connection, and freedom.

In Read Write Own, tech visionary Chris Dixon argues that the dream of an open network for fostering creativity and entrepreneurship doesn?t have to die and can, in fact, be saved with blockchain networks. He separates this movement, which aims to provide a solid foundation for everything from social networks to artificial intelligence to virtual worlds, from cryptocurrency speculation ?a distinction he calls ?the computer vs. the casino.??With lucid and compelling prose? drawing from a 25-year career in the software </p>

<p>Summary : A potent exploration of the power of blockchains to reshape the future of the internet?and how that affects us all?from influential technology entrepreneur and startup investor Chris DixonThe internet of today is a far cry from its early promise of a decentralized, democratic network of innovation, connection, and freedom. In the past decade, it has fallen almost entirely under the control of a very small group of companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook. In Read Write Own, tech visionary Chris Dixon argues that the dream of an open network for fostering creativity and entrepreneurship doesn?t have to die and can, in fact, be saved with blockchain networks. He separates this movement, which aims to provide a solid foundation for everything from social networks to artificial intelligence to virtual worlds, from cryptocurrency speculation ?a distinction he calls ?the computer vs. the casino.??With lucid and compelling prose? drawing from a 25-year career in the software </p>

<p>Summary : Doing well with money isn&#8217;t necessarily about what you know. It&#8217;s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money&#8211;investing, personal finance, and business decisions&#8211;is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don&#8217;t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life&#8217;s most important topics.</p>

Fresh after running fifty marathons in fifty days, the twenty-three-year-old had an idea: a 4000-kilometre run across Australia, averaging 100 kilometres per day with the aim of completing it in the fastest known time of 43 days. He wasn?t chasing fame or public recognition. He just wanted to test his limits and raise a million dollars for homelessness in the process.Most said he was crazy, others claimed it couldn?t be done. But those who know Nedd knew never to doubt him. They understood that this is someone who will do whatever it takes to finish what he started, and that when he commits his mind to something, he always gets it done.Understanding the mindset of someone predisposed to such feats of voluntary suffering has been nearly </p>

<p>Summary : What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of the new and familiar is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not. Computers, like us, confront limited space and time, so computer scientists have been grappling with similar problems for decades. And the solutions they&#8217;ve found have much to teach us.In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths show how algorithms developed for computers also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one&#8217;s inbox to peering into the future, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.</p>

Anthony a quatorze ans, et avec son cousin, pour tuer l?ennui, il d?cide de voler un cano? et d?aller voir ce qui se passe de l?autre c?t?, sur la fameuse plage des culs-nus. Au bout, ce sera pour Anthony le premier amour, le premier ?t?, celui qui d?cide de toute la suite. Ce sera le drame de la vie qui commence.Avec ce livre, Nicolas Mathieu ?crit le roman d?une vall?e, d?une ?poque, de l?adolescence, le r?cit politique d?une jeunesse qui doit trouver sa voie dans un monde qui meurt.

<p>Summary : The unauthorized, unvarnished story of famed Wall Street hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio.Ray Dalio does not want you to read this book.Late last year, when the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund on the planet, announced that he was stepping down from the company he started out of his apartment nearly 50 years ago, the news made headlines around the world.

<p>Summary : <br />
  Stunning for her daring originality, the author of Negroland gives us what she calls &#8220;a temperamental autobiography,&#8221; comprised of visceral, intimate fragments that fuse criticism and memoir. <br />
Margo Jefferson constructs a nervous system with pieces of different lengths and tone, conjoining arts writing (poem, song, performance) with life writing (history, psychology). The book&#8217;s structure is determined by signal moments of her life, those that trouble her as well as those that thrill and restore. In this nervous system:  &#8211; The sounds of a black spinning disc of a 1950&#8217;s jazz LP as intimate and instructive as a parent&#8217;s voice.  &#8211; The muscles and movements of a ballerina, spliced with those of an Olympic runner: template for what a female body could be. &#8211; Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s Topsy finds her way into the art of Kara Walker and the songs of C?cile McLorin Salvant. &#8211; Bing Crosby and Ike Turner become alter egos. &#8211; W.E.B. DuBois and George Eliot meet illicitly, as he appropriates </p>

<p>Summary : As a homeless teenager writing college essays in her rusty Toyota Corolla, Emi Nietfeld was convinced that the Ivy League was the only escape from her dysfunctional childhood. But upward mobility required crafting the perfect resilience narrative. She had to prove that she was an ?overcomer,? made stronger by all that she had endured.The truth was more complicated. Emi?s mom was a charming hoarder who had her put on antipsychotics but believed in her daughter?s brilliance?unlike the Minnesotan foster family who banned her ?pornographic? art history flash cards (of Michelangelo?s David). Emi?s other parent vanished shortly after coming out as trans, a situation few understood in the mid-2000s. Her own past was filled with mental health struggles, Adderall addiction, and the unbecoming desperation of a teenager fending for herself. And though Emi would go on to graduate from Harvard and become a software engineer at Google, she found that success didn?t necessarily mean safety.Both a </p>

The social whirl is decidedly not Alleyn s environment, so he brings in an assistant in the form of Lord Bunchy Gospell, everybody s favorite uncle. Bunchy is more than loveable; he s also got some serious sleuthing skills. But before he can unmask the blackmailer, a murder is announced. And everyone suddenly stops giggling.</p>

<p>Summary : CJ Hauser expands on her viral essay sensation, &#8220;The Crane Wife,&#8221; in a brilliant collection of essays that echo the work of Cheryl Strayed in their revelatory observations of romantic love.CJ Hauser uses her now-beloved title essay as an anchor around which to explore, through excavation of both her own personal and larger familial hope chest of &#8220;love stories,&#8221; the narratives of romantic love we are taught and which we tell ourselves, and the need to often rewrite those narratives to find an accurate version of ourselves in them.

<p>Summary : In this gripping stand-alone from bestselling author Mary Burton, an FBI agent must catch a copycat killer. The only difference this time: she?s the final victim.Catching monsters helps FBI agent Kate Hayden keep her nightmares at bay. Now an urgent call brings her back to San Antonio, the scene of her violent past. A brutal new murder shows hallmarks of a serial killer nicknamed the Samaritan. Tricky part is, Kate already caught him.Either Kate made a deadly error, or she?s got a copycat on her hands. Paired with homicide detective Theo Mazur, she quickly realizes this murder is more twisted than it first appeared. Then a second body is found, the mode of death identical to a different case that Kate thought she?d put behind her.Now Kate and Detective Mazur aren?t just working a homicide; the investigative pair is facing a formidable enemy who knows Kate intimately. While Mazur is personally trying to protect Kate, the closer they are drawn to the killer, the clearer it becomes that </p>

<p>Summary : In this gripping stand-alone from bestselling author Mary Burton, an FBI agent must catch a copycat killer. The only difference this time: she?s the final victim.Catching monsters helps FBI agent Kate Hayden keep her nightmares at bay. Now an urgent call brings her back to San Antonio, the scene of her violent past. A brutal new murder shows hallmarks of a serial killer nicknamed the Samaritan. Tricky part is, Kate already caught him.Either Kate made a deadly error, or she?s got a copycat on her hands. Paired with homicide detective Theo Mazur, she quickly realizes this murder is more twisted than it first appeared. Then a second body is found, the mode of death identical to a different case that Kate thought she?d put behind her.Now Kate and Detective Mazur aren?t just working a homicide; the investigative pair is facing a formidable enemy who knows Kate intimately. While Mazur is personally trying to protect Kate, the closer they are drawn to the killer, the clearer it becomes that </p>

<p>Summary : We are in the second decade of the 21st century and, as with most things, the distinction between digital and analogue has become tired and inappropriate. This is also true in the world of architectural drawing, which paradoxically is enjoying a renaissance supported by the graphic dexterity of the computer. This new fecundity has produced a contemporary glut of stunning architectural drawings and representations that could rival the most recent outpouring of architectural vision in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Indeed, there is much to learn by comparing the then and the now. The contemporary drawing is often about its ability to describe the change, fluctuations and mutability of architecture in relation to the virtual/real 21st-century continuum of architectural space. Times have changed, and the status of the architectural drawing must change with them. This reassessment is well overdue, and this edition of &#8220;AD&#8221; will be the catalyst for such re-examination.Features the work of: </p>

<p>Summary : Listening time: 9 hours and 18 minutes.The bad news? Getting hit by a cab can officially get crossed off my bucket list.The worse news? While I?ve woken up from my coma, the man I?m in love with hasn?t stirred from his. And the most terrible news of all? A pregnant woman is at his bedside, holding his hand, and saying that he?s the father of her baby. Sammy Baker is a divorced, single mom trying to find her way again. With two boys and an absent ex-husband, she?s got the world on her shoulders and Legos under her feet.Amid the chaos lives the dream of, one day, finding love again. Though, she didn?t think that would land her smack-dab in the middle of two men. Will Sammy choose the successful businessman who doesn?t hesitate to tell her he?s interested? Or will she go for the eligible bachelor doctor with a constant influx of women vying for his attention? The smart choice and what the heart wants are two different things. And sometimes, fate has a way of making it so the choice </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  The first major biography of one of our most influential but least known judicial activists that provides an eye-opening account of the twin struggles for gender equality and civil rights in the 20th century. <br />
Born to an aspirational blue-collar family during the Great Depression, Constance Baker Motley was expected to find herself a good career as a hair dresser. Instead, she became the first Black woman to argue a case in front of the Supreme Court, the first of ten she would eventually argue. The only Black woman member in the legal team at the NAACP&#8217;s Inc. Fund at the time, she defended Martin Luther King, Jr. in Birmingham, helped to argue Brown vs. The Board of Education, and played a critical role in vanquishing Jim Crow laws throughout the South. She was the first Black woman elected to the state Senate in New York, the first woman elected Manhattan Borough President, and the first Black woman appointed to the federal judiciary.Civil Rights Queen captures the story of a </p>

<p>Summary : Anton Chekhov is revered as a boldly innovative playwright and short story writer?but he wrote more than just plays and stories. In Alive in the Writing?an intriguing hybrid of writing guide, biography, and literary analysis?anthropologist and novelist Kirin Narayan introduces readers to some other sides of Chekhov: his pithy, witty observations on the writing process, his life as a writer through accounts by his friends, family, and lovers, and his venture into nonfiction through his book Sakhalin Island. By closely attending to the people who lived under the appalling conditions of the Russian penal colony on Sakhalin, Chekhov showed how empirical details combined with a literary flair can bring readers face to face with distant, different lives, enlarging a sense of human responsibility. Highlighting this balance of the empirical and the literary, Narayan calls on Chekhov to bring new energy to the writing of ethnography and creative nonfiction alike. Weaving together selections </p>

By closely attending to the people who lived under the appalling conditions of the Russian penal colony on Sakhalin, Chekhov showed how empirical details combined with a literary flair can bring readers face to face with distant, different lives, enlarging a sense of human responsibility. Highlighting this balance of the empirical and the literary, Narayan calls on Chekhov to bring new energy to the writing of ethnography and creative nonfiction alike. Weaving together selections </p>

<p>Summary : Punch Me Up to the Gods introduces a powerful new talent in Brian Broome, whose early years growing up in Ohio as a dark-skinned?Black boy harboring crushes on other boys propel forward this gorgeous, aching, and unforgettable debut. Brian?s recounting of his experiences?in all their cringe-worthy, hilarious, and heartbreaking glory?reveal a perpetual outsider awkwardly squirming to find his way in.Indiscriminate sex and escalating drug use help to soothe his hurt, young psyche, usually to uproarious and devastating effect.

But it is Brian?s voice in the retelling that shows the true depth of vulnerability for young Black boys that is often quietly near to bursting at the seams.Cleverly framed around Gwendolyn Brooks?s poem ?We Real Cool,? the iconic and loving ode to Black boyhood, Punch Me Up to the Gods is at once playful, poignant, and wholly original. Broome?s writing brims with swagger and </p>

<p>Summary : Autobiografico e psicoanalitico, medico e immaginifico, questo libro concepito in tre stanze ? il corpo ricordato, il corpo dettagliato, il corpo ritrovato ? ci accompagna in un viaggio avventuroso all?interno del corpo, celebrando la sua fisicit? senza separarla dalla sua poetica.

Con le spiegazioni della scienza, le immagini dell?arte, le parole della letteratura, Vittorio Lingiardi racconta la vita del corpo che ? ?il nostro io, ma anche il primo tu?. Nella sua pratica clinica, nell?esercizio della cura, ne ha ascoltati molti, di corpi. La ricerca del contatto e dell?attaccamento, il tumulto dell?adolescenza, l?esperienza della malattia, il risveglio del desiderio, le metamorfosi del genere.

<p>Summary : A deliciously witty and inspiring memoir by One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz about her decade in a cult and her quest to break free. In the early 2000s, after years of hard work and determination to breakthrough as an actor, Bethany Joy Lenz was finally cast as one of the leads on the hit drama One Tree Hill. Her career was about to take off, but her personal life was slowly beginning to unravel. What none of the show?s millions of fans knew, hidden even from her costars, was her secret double life in a cult. An only child who often had to fend for herself and always wanted a place to belong, Lenz found the safe haven she?d been searching for in a Bible study group with other Hollywood creatives. However, the group soon morphed into something more sinister?a slowly woven web of manipulation, abuse, and fear under the guise of a church covenant called The Big House Family. Piece by piece, Lenz began to give away her autonomy, ultimately relocating to the Family?s Pacific Northwest </p>

<p>Summary : A deliciously witty and inspiring memoir by One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz about her decade in a cult and her quest to break free. In the early 2000s, after years of hard work and determination to breakthrough as an actor, Bethany Joy Lenz was finally cast as one of the leads on the hit drama One Tree Hill. Her career was about to take off, but her personal life was slowly beginning to unravel. What none of the show?s millions of fans knew, hidden even from her costars, was her secret double life in a cult. An only child who often had to fend for herself and always wanted a place to belong, Lenz found the safe haven she?d been searching for in a Bible study group with other Hollywood creatives. However, the group soon morphed into something more sinister?a slowly woven web of manipulation, abuse, and fear under the guise of a church covenant called The Big House Family. Piece by piece, Lenz began to give away her autonomy, ultimately relocating to the Family?s Pacific Northwest </p>

<p>Summary : I have a nice life &#8211; living in my hometown, owning the coffee shop I?ve worked at since I was 16.It?s comfortable.On paper.But I?m tired of doing everything by myself. Tired of being in charge of every decision in my life.I want someone to lean on. Someone to spend time with. Sit with. Hug.And I really don?t want to go to my best friend?s wedding alone.So, I signed up for a dating app, and agreed to meet with the first guy that messaged me.And now here I am, at the bar.Only it?s not my date that just sat down in the chair across from me. It?s his dad.And holy hell, he?s the definition of Silver Fox. If a Silver Fox can be thick as a house, have piercing blue eyes and tattoos from his neck down to his fingertips.He?s giving me Big Bad Wolf vibes. Only instead of running, I?m blushing. And he looks like he might just want to eat me whole.</p>

Charting the most cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels, regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer&#8217;s and diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase longevity.

<p>Summary : The day Christopher saved a drowning baby griffin from a hidden lake would change his life forever. It&#8217;s the day he learned about the Archipelago, a cluster of unmapped islands where magical creatures of every kind have thrived for thousands of years?until now. And it&#8217;s the day he met Mal, a girl on the run who desperately needs his help. Mal and Christopher embark on a wild adventure, racing from island to island, searching for someone who can explain why the magic is fading and why magical creatures are suddenly dying. They consult sphinxes, battle kraken, and negotiate with dragons. But the closer they get to the dark truth of what&#8217;s happening, the clearer it becomes: no one else can fix this. If the Archipelago is to be saved, Mal and Christopher will have to do it themselves.</p>

Mixed Plate illuminates the burning drive and unique humor that make Jo Koy one of today?s most successful comedians. Includes never-before-seen photos.Well guys, here it is?my story.

With all the details of what it felt like to get the doors closed in my face, to grind it out on the road with my arsenal of dick jokes, and how my career finally took off once I embraced the craziness of my family, which I always thought </p>

Since 1972, he has directed a health clinic in Florida, successfully helping people cure themselves of cancer, diabetes, M.S., Crohn&#8217;s disease, along with both brain and nerve damage. His &#8220;miracle&#8221; approach is fully detailed in this comprehensive book.The cause of illness is poison (acidosis), i.e., toxins from our food, water and air. No genuine healing can proceed in such a toxified environment. Morse&#8217;s system is to treat the cause of illness, not the symptoms The Detox Miracle Sourcebook shows you how to use raw foods and herbs as of the primary means of detoxification, healing, and ultimate regeneration of weak or diseased cells.This book is called a &#8220;sourcebook&#8221; because of the vast reference material it contains.

As a child, she watched her mother, abandoned by her husband, provide for her three small children without &#8220;resources or voice.&#8221; Isabel became a fierce and defiant little girl, determined to fight for the life her mother couldn&#8217;t have.As a young woman coming of age in the late 1960s, she rode the second wave of feminism.

She has seen what the movement has accomplished in the course of her lifetime. And over the course of three passionate marriages, she has learned how to grow as a woman while having a partner, when to step away, and the rewards of embracing one&#8217;s </p>

<p>Summary : Loki&#8217;s fourth doodle-packed diary in the number one best-selling series.Loki has made a fair few enemies during his time in Asgard. Too many to count and certainly too many to remember. When the elf, Vinir beams Loki aboard his chariot and challenges him to a magical duel, Loki hasn&#8217;t got a clue why. Sweet talking his way out of a fight by pointing out there&#8217;s little honour in duelling someone who can&#8217;t remember how they wronged you, and even less in picking on a child, Loki is returned safely to school. That is until Vinir shows up in child form, as resolute as ever about seeking that duel&#8230; and vengeance.</p>

<p>Summary : Waking the Tiger offers a new and hopeful vision of trauma. It views the human animal as a unique being, endowed with an instinctual capacity. It asks and answers an intriguing question: why are animals in the wild, though threatened routinely, rarely traumatized? By understanding the dynamics that make wild animals virtually immune to traumatic symptoms, the mystery of human trauma is revealed.Waking the Tiger normalizes the symptoms of trauma and the steps needed to heal them. People are often traumatized by seemingly ordinary experiences. The reader is taken on a guided tour of the subtle, yet powerful impulses that govern our responses to overwhelming life events. To do this, it employs a series of exercises that help us focus on bodily sensations. Through heightened awareness of these sensations trauma can be healed.</p>

<p>Summary : For the last decade, Giuseppe Santamaria has observed and recorded the men of big cities while they cross streets, sit at cafes, and pose, momentarily, on busy sidewalks. Traveling the continents, Giuseppe has documented the evolution of men&#8217;s identities, communicated through their attitude and style as they move through their different concrete jungles.With photos shot in Sydney, New York, Tokyo, Milan, London, Melbourne, Toronto, L.A., Madrid, Florence and Paris, this collection is a truly global retrospective of men&#8217;s street fashion. Filled with striking photographs, Men In This Town is a record of the men who stick out in a crowd with their particular sense of just who and what they are.For anyone with a love of photography, fashion, or culture&#8217;s evolution, Giuseppe&#8217;s photography collection is a must have.</p>

L?autrice ha scelto ancora una volta di raccogliere la sfida e, partendo dalle storie dei suoi pazienti, con lucidit? ed empatia ha indagato le origini di questi interrogativi: il timore di mettersi in </p>

<p>Summary : The riveting, unforgettable story of a girl whose indomitable spirit is tested by homelessness, poverty, and racism in an unequal America?from Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andrea Elliott of The New York TimesInvisible Child follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani Coates, a child with an imagination as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn homeless shelter. Born at the turn of a new century, Dasani is named for the bottled water that comes to symbolize Brooklyn?s gentrification and the shared aspirations of a divided city.

By the time Dasani comes of age, New York City?s homeless crisis is exploding as the chasm deepens between rich and poor. In the shadows of this new Gilded Age, Dasani must lead her seven siblings through a thicket of problems: hunger, parental drug addiction, </p>

<p>Summary : Los pa?ses de Westalis y Ostania libran desde hace a?os una guerra fr?a donde el espionaje y los asesinatos son moneda corriente. El inigualable esp?a conocido como ?Twilight? es el mejor agente de Westalis que tiene por objetivo encargarse del poderoso Donovan Desmond. El problema es que Desmond es un ermita?o antisocial cuyas ?nicas apariciones p?blicas son en los actos escolares de su hijo. Twilight deber? acercarse al objetivo lo suficiente como para desbaratar su agenda secreta. Para ello, s?lo deber? simular que es un hombre de familia&#8230; con el peque?o detalle de que s?lo tiene 7 d?as para conseguir la familia ideal. Es por eso que bajo la identidad del psiquiatra Loid Forger, Twilight reclutar? a Yor Briar, una civil ostaniana que quiere tener bajo perfil y Anya, una huerfanita que s?lo busca una familia cari?osa, para hacer las partes de esposa e hija respectivamente. Pero resulta que este par tampoco es nada normal, especialmente si tenemos en cuenta que Yor es una asesina </p>
