<p>Summary : From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs?officially, the research and development wing of AT&amp;T?was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, it?s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn?t been touched by Bell Labs.Why did so many transformative ideas come from Bell Labs? In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century?s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men?Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker?who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Their job was to research and develop the future of communications. Small-town boys, childhood hobbyists, oddballs: they give the lie to the idea that Bell Labs was a grim cathedral of top-down command and </p>

<p>Summary : Es ist an der Zeit, sich nicht mehr zu fragen, was Erfolg ausmacht ? sondern es zu wissen?ber einen Zeitraum von mehr als 20 Jahren interviewte der blutjunge Napoleon Hill mehr als 500 Million?re, unter ihnen die m?chtigsten und einflussreichsten Pers?nlichkeiten seiner Zeit wie Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller oder Theodore Roosevelt. Die Essenz seiner Studien ist indieses Buch eingeflossen. Herausgekommen ist eine ebenso zeitlose wie ?berzeugende Anleitung f?r pers?nlichen Erfolg, in der Napoleon Hill zeigt, wie man in nur 13 Schritten sein Leben ver?ndern kann ? das wom?glich wichtigste Finanzbuch, das jemals geschrieben wurde.Mit ?ber 60 Millionen verkauften Exemplaren geh?rt Napoleon Hills Denke nach und werde reich zu den erfolgreichsten B?chern aller Zeiten. Nun ist erstmals die vollst?ndige und ungek?rzte Ausgabe von 1937 auf Deutsch erh?ltlich.</p>

<p>Summary : Celebrated NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg delivers an extraordinary memoir of her personal successes, struggles, and life-affirming relationships, including her beautiful friendship of nearly fifty years with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Four years before Nina Totenberg was hired at NPR, where she cemented her legacy as a prizewinning reporter, and nearly twenty-two years before Ruth Bader Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court, Nina called Ruth. A reporter for The National Observer, Nina was curious about Ruth?s legal brief, asking the Supreme Court to do something declare a law that discriminated ?on the basis of sex? to be unconstitutional. In a time when women were fired for becoming pregnant, often could not apply for credit cards or get a mortgage in their own names, Ruth patiently explained her argument. That call launched a remarkable, nearly fifty-year friendship. Dinners with Ruth is an extraordinary account of two women who paved the way for future </p>

<p>Summary : Celebrated NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg delivers an extraordinary memoir of her personal successes, struggles, and life-affirming relationships, including her beautiful friendship of nearly fifty years with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Four years before Nina Totenberg was hired at NPR, where she cemented her legacy as a prizewinning reporter, and nearly twenty-two years before Ruth Bader Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court, Nina called Ruth. A reporter for The National Observer, Nina was curious about Ruth?s legal brief, asking the Supreme Court to do something declare a law that discriminated ?on the basis of sex? to be unconstitutional. In a time when women were fired for becoming pregnant, often could not apply for credit cards or get a mortgage in their own names, Ruth patiently explained her argument. That call launched a remarkable, nearly fifty-year friendship. Dinners with Ruth is an extraordinary account of two women who paved the way for future </p>

<p>Summary : The seductive and action-packed follow-up to Alex Aster?s instant #1 New York Times, #1 Wall Street Journal, and internationally bestselling novel, LightlarkIsla Crown has secured the love of two powerful rulers and broken the curses that plagued the six realms for centuries, but few know the true origins of her powers.Now, in the wake of a crushing betrayal, Isla finds herself struggling to win respect as the newly crowned leader of two separate realms. Worse, her fellow rulers haven?t ceded victory quietly, and there are others in Isla?s midst who don?t believe her ascent to power was earned.As certain death races toward Lightlark and secrets from the past begin to unravel, Isla must weigh her responsibility to her people against the whims of the most dangerous traitor of all: her heart.Alex Aster?s intricate world expands after the riveting culmination of the Centennial games, delving more deeply into Isla?s memories of her past, as her future hurtles toward two possible fates.</p>

<p>Summary : Market corrections are as constant as seasons are in nature. There have been 30 such corrections in the past 30 years, yet there&#8217;s never been an action plan for how not only to survive, but thrive through each change in the stock market. Building upon the principles in Money: Master the Game, Robbins offers the reader specific steps they can implement to protect their investments while maximizing their wealth. It&#8217;s a detailed guide designed for investors, articulated in the common-sense, practical manner that the millions of loyal Robbins fans and students have come to expect and rely upon. Few have navigated the turbulence of the stock market as adeptly and successfully as Tony Robbins. His proven, consistent success over decades makes him singularly qualified to help investors (both seasoned and first-timers alike) preserve and add to their investments.</p>

<p>Summary : In this New York Times bestseller, Rolling Stone founder, co-editor, and publisher Jann Wenner offers a &#8220;touchingly honest&#8221; and &#8220;wonderfully deep&#8221;?memoir from the beating heart of classic rock and roll (Bruce Springsteen). Jann Wenner has been called by his peers ?the greatest editor of his generation.?His deeply personal memoir vividly describes and brings you inside the music, the politics, and the lifestyle of a generation, an epoch of cultural change that swept America and beyond.

Thompson, Tom Wolfe, and Annie Leibovitz. His journey took him to the Oval Office with his legendary interviews with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, leaders </p>

<p>Summary : Tired of the fast-paced city life, Izuki has agreed to take care of his uncle&#8217;s house in the mountains, which are said to be &#8220;visited by yokai.&#8221; Izuki, dismissive of the superstition, goes exploring ? only to be attacked by a yokai in the woods. He&#8217;s saved by a beautiful man named Haku, who claims to be the incarnation of a komainu guardian dog. He pledges himself to Izuki and begs him to be his master.

Gradually, he falls into a comfortable rhythm with the pushy but devoted Haku while living under the same roof, and Izuki wonders if he really wants to return to the city as he thought. However, Haku harbors a secret that could put Izuki&#8217;s life at risk. Will Izuki and Haku come together in the end, or will Haku succumb to the loneliness that he&#8217;s held at bay for centuries&#8230;?

<p>Summary : No one knows for certain what caused the Shadow to come into existence. Clerics say it was the gods laying a curse upon this world. Philosophers maintain that the Shadow of Strix is nothing short of a blessing and new milestone in human progress. But both sides agree that the Shadow will eventually swallow up this world and change it beyond recognition.However, there are also the mages, and they think the whole debate is just so much hot air. They accept the Shadow as is with all its horrors and wonders. Furthermore, for the last several centuries, mages have risked their lives attempting to harness the Shadow?s Power for themselves.Unsurprisingly, only a select few have access to knowledge about the Shadow?s magic. Max Renard understands that, so he chooses a different and more hazardous path. He decides to head for the frontier himself to experience the Shadow?s Power firsthand.</p>

<p>Summary : In 2010 world-renowned innovation expert Clayton M. Christensen gave a powerful speech to the Harvard Business School&#8217;s graduating class. Drawing upon his business research, he offered a series of guidelines for finding meaning and happiness in life. He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness.The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father&#8217;s life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question &#8220;How do you measure your life?&#8221; became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students.In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I&#8217;ll find satisfaction in my career? How can I be sure that my personal relationships become </p>

Their humble beach-town rental has been the site of sweet memories, sunny days, great meals, and messes of all kinds: emotional, marital, and?thanks to the cottage?s ancient plumbing?septic too.This year?s vacation, with Rocky sandwiched between her half-grown kids and fully aging parents, promises to be just as delightful as summers past?except, perhaps, for Rocky?s hormonal bouts of rage and melancholy.

He has to marry her first.And they can?t stand each other.</p>

<p>Summary : The Ramayana, one of the world?s greatest epics, is also a tragic love story. In this brilliant retelling, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni places Sita at the centre of the novel: this is Sita?s version. The Forest of Enchantments is also a very human story of some of the other women in the epic, often misunderstood and relegated to the margins: Kaikeyi, Surpanakha, Mandodari. A powerful comment on duty, betrayal, infidelity and honour, it is also about women?s struggle to retain autonomy in a world that privileges men, as Chitra transforms an ancient story into a gripping, contemporary battle of wills. While the Ramayana resonates even today, she makes it more relevant than ever, in the underlying questions in the novel: How should women be treated by their loved ones? What are their rights in a relationship? When does a woman need to stand up and say, ?Enough!?</p>

<p>Summary : Un viaggio con suo padre verso il paesino tra le Dolomiti da cui proviene la famiglia paterna sarebbe la scusa perfetta per capire meglio Genitore 2, ma Zerocalcare e suo padre sono incapaci di parlarsi di cose significative. Questo rende difficile la trasferta, quando si capisce che la loro famiglia non ? vista di buon occhio, anzi, da alcuni ? proprio odiata, in paese. Le radici dell&#8217;odio risalgono a prima della Grande guerra, e si intrecciano al mistero che circonda, da trentacinque anni, il giorno pi? misterioso ed emblematico della vita di Calcare, quello che lui fin da bambino ricorda come &#8220;Il giorno di Merman&#8221;. Negli interstizi dei non detti, l&#8217;amore incrollabile di un padre per il suo unico figlio attraversa alcune delle pagine pi? buie della Storia del nostro Paese, silenziosamente coraggioso. Una storia in cui Zerocalcare si costringe a guardarsi allo specchio e non si fa sconti nel raccontare ci? che vede.</p>

<p>Summary : Un viaggio con suo padre verso il paesino tra le Dolomiti da cui proviene la famiglia paterna sarebbe la scusa perfetta per capire meglio Genitore 2, ma Zerocalcare e suo padre sono incapaci di parlarsi di cose significative. Questo rende difficile la trasferta, quando si capisce che la loro famiglia non ? vista di buon occhio, anzi, da alcuni ? proprio odiata, in paese. Le radici dell&#8217;odio risalgono a prima della Grande guerra, e si intrecciano al mistero che circonda, da trentacinque anni, il giorno pi? misterioso ed emblematico della vita di Calcare, quello che lui fin da bambino ricorda come &#8220;Il giorno di Merman&#8221;. Negli interstizi dei non detti, l&#8217;amore incrollabile di un padre per il suo unico figlio attraversa alcune delle pagine pi? buie della Storia del nostro Paese, silenziosamente coraggioso. Una storia in cui Zerocalcare si costringe a guardarsi allo specchio e non si fa sconti nel raccontare ci? che vede.</p>

<p>Summary : When Shrewsbury Castle falls, Brother Cadfael discovers a murder mystery amid the wreckage.In the summer of 1138, war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud takes Brother Cadfael from the quiet world of his garden into a battlefield of passions, deceptions, and death. Not far from the safety of the abbey walls, Shrewsbury Castle falls, leaving its ninety-four defenders loyal to the empress to hang as traitors. With a heavy heart, Brother Cadfael agrees to bury the dead, only to make a grisly discovery: one extra victim that has been strangled, not hanged. This ingenious way to dispose of a corpse tells Brother Cadfael that the killer is both clever and ruthless. But one death among so many seems unimportant to all but the good Benedictine. He vows to find the truth behind disparate clues: a girl in boy?s clothing, a missing treasure, and a single broken flower . . . the tiny bit of evidence that Cadfael believes can expose a murderer?s black heart.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  The future isn&#8217;t about where we will work, but how. For years we have struggled to balance work and life, with most of us feeling overwhelmed and burned out because our relationship to work is broken. This &#8220;isn&#8217;t just a book about remote work. It&#8217;s a book that helps us imagine a future where our lives&#8211;at the office and home&#8211;are happier, more productive, and genuinely meaningful&#8221; (Charles Duhigg, best-selling author of The Power of Habit). <br />
Out of Office is a book for every office worker &#8211; from employees to managers &#8211; currently facing the decision about whether, and how, to return to the office. The past two years have shown us that there may be a new path forward, one that doesn&#8217;t involve hellish daily commutes and the demands of jam-packed work schedules that no longer make sense. But how can we realize that future in a way that benefits workers and companies alike?Based on groundbreaking reporting and interviews with workers and managers around the world,  Out of Office </p>

<p>Summary : Oliver Marks has just served ten years for a murder he may or may not have committed. On the day of his release, he is greeted by the detective who put him in prison. Detective Colborne is retiring, and he wants to know what really happened a decade before.As a young actor at an elite conservatory, Oliver noticed that his talented classmates seem to play the same characters onstage and off ? villain, hero, temptress ? though he was always a supporting role. But when the teachers change the casting, a good-natured rivalry turns ugly, and the plays spill dangerously over into real life.When tragedy strikes, one of the seven friends is found dead. The rest face their greatest acting challenge yet: convincing the police, and themselves, that they are blameless&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : An ancient evil, a terrible prophecy &#8212; and five dragonets who could save the world&#8230;Don&#8217;t miss the most thrilling adventure yet in the New York Times bestselling Wings of Fire series! Qibli knows Darkstalker must be stopped. And he knows he could stop him &#8212; if he had magic. With even a sliver of the ancient dragon&#8217;s all-powerful scroll, Qibli could rewrite history the right end war forever; make every dragon happy; perhaps even cast a very small spell so that everyone would like him&#8230;Instead, as Darkstalker&#8217;s dangerous influence spreads across Pyrrhia, entrancing or killing every dragon in the seven tribes, Qibli can only grasp the small animus objects he&#8217;s borrowed from Turtle. With some clever thinking, Qibli&#8217;s talons finally hold the power to make a difference. But prophecies are not easy to rewrite. Can Qibli be the magical force Pyrrhia needs, or will he be the one to bring Jade Mountain &#8212; and his family, his friends, his whole world &#8212; crashing down?</p>

<p>Summary : An inspirational and practical book written by two high-achieving women, sharing the experience and advice of some of our most extraordinary women leaders, in their own words.From their broad experience on the world stage in politics, economics and global not-for-profits, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Julia Gillard have some strong ideas about the impact of gender on the treatment of leaders. Women and Leadership takes a consistent and comprehensive approach to teasing out what is different for women leaders.

<p>Summary : An inspirational and practical book written by two high-achieving women, sharing the experience and advice of some of our most extraordinary women leaders, in their own words.From their broad experience on the world stage in politics, economics and global not-for-profits, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Julia Gillard have some strong ideas about the impact of gender on the treatment of leaders. Women and Leadership takes a consistent and comprehensive approach to teasing out what is different for women leaders. Almost every year new findings are published about the way people see women leaders compared with their male counterparts. The authors have taken that academic work and tested it in the real world. The same set of interview questions were put to each leader in frank face-to-face interviews. Their responses were then used to examine each woman&#8217;s journey in leadership and whether their lived experiences were in line with or different from what the research would predict.Women and </p>

<p>Summary : In this triumphant memoir, Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer Prize-winning coauthor of All the President?s Men and pioneer of investigative journalism, recalls his beginnings as an audacious teenage newspaper reporter in the nation?s capital?a winning tale of scrapes, gumshoeing, and American bedlam.In 1960, Bernstein was just a sixteen-year-old at considerable risk of failing to graduate high school. Inquisitive, self-taught?and, yes, truant?Bernstein landed a job as a copyboy at the Evening Star, the afternoon paper in Washington. By nineteen, he was a reporter there. In Chasing History: A Kid in the Newsroom, Bernstein recalls the origins of his storied journalistic career as he chronicles the Kennedy era, the swelling civil rights movement, and a slew of grisly crimes. He spins a buoyant, frenetic account of educating himself in what Bob Woodward describes as ?the genius of perpetual engagement.? Funny and exhilarating, poignant and frank, Chasing History is an extraordinary memoir of </p>

<p>Summary : The smash-hit New York Times bestselling picture book about feeling your feelings is now available as a board book!Jim the chimpanzee is in a terrible mood for no good reason. His friends can&#8217;t understand it&#8211;how can he be in a bad mood when it&#8217;s SUCH a beautiful day? They encourage him not to hunch, to smile, and to do things that make THEM happy. But Jim can&#8217;t take all the advice&#8230;and has a bit of a meltdown. Could it be that he just needs a day to feel grumpy?Suzanne and Max Lang&#8217;s hilarious approach to this very important lesson is now in a toddler-friendly board book format! It is an excellent case study in the dangers of putting on a happy face and demonstrates to kids that they are allowed to feel their feelings (though they should be careful of hurting others in the process!).</p>

The book that inspired the Choose Kind movement.I won?t describe what I look like. Whatever you?re thinking, it?s probably worse. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid?but his new classmates can?t get past Auggie?s extraordinary face.

<p>Summary : Sono trascorsi quarant?anni da quando il figlio del fabbro di Dovia ha mosso i primi passi in politica; quasi venti da quando ha impugnato lo scettro del potere; poche settimane da quando ha annunciato agli italiani che il destino batte l?ora della guerra. Proprio adesso, alla fine di giugno del 1940, quel destino offre al Duce un segno, forse un presagio: Italo Balbo, il condottiero della Milizia, il maresciallo dell?aria celebre in tutto il mondo, viene abbattuto in volo dal fuoco amico. Ma non c?? pi? tempo per volgersi indietro. Affinch? la Storia metta in scena l?immane tragedia della guerra, ciascuno deve interpretare la sua parte. Come il generale Mario Roatta, feroce pianificatore di rappresaglie e capo di un esercito spaventosamente impreparato. Come Galeazzo Ciano, ossessionato dall?idea di dominare il Mediterraneo; Edda, pronta a unirsi alla Croce rossa per avere la sua prima linea; Clara Petacci, che stringe tra le braccia un uomo sempre pi? simile a un fantasma; Amerigo </p>

<p>Summary : Sono trascorsi quarant?anni da quando il figlio del fabbro di Dovia ha mosso i primi passi in politica; quasi venti da quando ha impugnato lo scettro del potere; poche settimane da quando ha annunciato agli italiani che il destino batte l?ora della guerra. Proprio adesso, alla fine di giugno del 1940, quel destino offre al Duce un segno, forse un presagio: Italo Balbo, il condottiero della Milizia, il maresciallo dell?aria celebre in tutto il mondo, viene abbattuto in volo dal fuoco amico. Ma non c?? pi? tempo per volgersi indietro. Affinch? la Storia metta in scena l?immane tragedia della guerra, ciascuno deve interpretare la sua parte. Come il generale Mario Roatta, feroce pianificatore di rappresaglie e capo di un esercito spaventosamente impreparato. Come Galeazzo Ciano, ossessionato dall?idea di dominare il Mediterraneo; Edda, pronta a unirsi alla Croce rossa per avere la sua prima linea; Clara Petacci, che stringe tra le braccia un uomo sempre pi? simile a un fantasma; Amerigo </p>

<p>Summary : A powerful memoir that reckons with mental health as well as the insidious ways men impact the lives of women.In early 2021, popular artist Anna Marie Tendler checked herself into a psychiatric hospital following a year of crippling anxiety, depression and self-harm. Over two weeks, she underwent myriad psychological tests, participated in numerous therapy sessions, connected with fellow patients and experienced profound breakthroughs, such as when a doctor noted, ?There is a you inside that feels invisible to those looking at you from the outside.?In Men Have Called Her Crazy, Tendler recounts her hospital experience as well as pivotal moments in her life that preceded and followed. As the title suggests, many of these moments are impacted by men: unrequited love in high school; the twenty-eight-year-old she lost her virginity to when she was sixteen; the frustrations and absurdities of dating in her mid-thirties; and her decision to freeze her eggs as all her friends were starting </p>

Quando la glasnost, la trasparenza, dava improvvisamente voce al dissenso, quando si aprivano gli archivi e affiorava la memoria sepolta delle tragedie del passato, quando esisteva ancora l?Unione Sovietica e nell?immenso paese convivevano, senza sforzo apparente, russi e ucraini, azeri e armeni, e sotto la facciata del comunismo ortodosso ribolliva di tutto, dall?affarismo mafioso all?integralismo islamico.In quella Russia in bilico fra ingenue speranze e oscuri presentimenti si muovono la giovane storica Tanja, impegnata in una tesi su un argomento fino a poco tempo prima proibito; il giudice Nazar, che cerca di non perdere la sua umanit? mentre indaga su crimini efferati; e l?attore Mark, ossessionato dal romanzo che sta scrivendo sullo sterminio degli ebrei di Odessa.

<p>Summary : In this uproariously funny memoir, Ludwig Bemelmans uncovers the fabulous world of the Hotel Splendide, the luxury New York hotel where he worked as a waiter. With equal parts affection and barbed wit, he records the everyday chaos that reigns behind the smooth facades of the gilded dining room and banquet halls.In hilarious detail, Bemelmans sketches the hierarchy of hotel life and its strange and fascinating inhabitants: from the ruthlessly authoritarian ma?tre d?h?tel Monsieur Victor to the kindly waiter Mespoulets to Frizl the homesick busboy. Illustrated with his own charming line drawings, Bemelmans? tales of a bygone era of extravagance are as charming as they are riotously entertaining.</p>

<p>Summary : Speck is not a good boy. He is a terrible boy, a defiant, self-destructive, often malodorous boy, a grave robber and screen door moocher who spends his days playing chicken with the Fed Ex man, picking fights with thousand-pound livestock, and rolling in donkey manure, and his nights howling at the moon. He has been that way since the moment he appeared on the ridgeline behind Rick Bragg&#8217;s house, a starved and half-dead creature, seventy-six pounds of wet hair and poor decisions.Speck arrived in Rick&#8217;s life at a moment of looming uncertainty. A cancer diagnosis, chemo, kidney failure, and recurring pneumonia had left Rick lethargic and melancholy. Speck helped, and he is helping, still, when he is not peeing on the Rose of Sharon. Written with Bragg&#8217;s inimitable blend of tenderness and sorrow, humor and grit, The Speckled Beauty captures the extraordinary, sustaining devotion between two damaged creatures who need each other to heal.</p>

<p>Summary : The spellbinding tale of an epic international manhunt for a psychopathic con artist who stole dozens of identities and millions of dollars while exploiting the dreams of artists from Hollywood, Jakarta, London and beyond. Blending years of deep reporting with distinctive, powerful prose, Scott C. Johnson&#8217;s unique true crime narrative recounts the tale of the brilliantly cunning imposter who carved a path of financial and emotional destruction across the world. Gifted with a diabolical flair for impersonation, manipulation, and deception, the Con Queen used his skill with accents and deft psychological insight to sweep through the entertainment industry. Johnson traces the origins of this gender-bending criminal mastermind and follows the years-long investigation of a singularly determined private detective who helped deliver him to the FBI. Described by one victim as a &#8220;crazy, evil genius,&#8221; the Con Queen brazenly worked in an evolving, borderless world in which our notions of </p>

<p>Summary : ?Were we gangsters? No. But did we know how to start a fire??In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He is returned to his wife and kids less than a week later, only slightly the worse, and the family moves on with their lives, resuming their prized places in the saga of the American dream, comforted in the realization that though their money may have been what endangered them, it is also what assured them their safety.But now, nearly forty years later, it?s clear that perhaps nobody ever got over anything, after all. Carl has spent the ensuing years secretly seeking closure to the matter of his kidnapping, while his wife, Ruth, has spent her potential protecting her husband?s emotional health. Their three grown children aren?t doing much better: Nathan?s chronic fear won?t allow him to advance at his law firm; Beamer, a Hollywood screenwriter, will consume anything?substance, foodstuff, women?in order to </p>
