<p>Summary : <br />
  Sticks and stones may break our bones? <br />
 Hockey is my life. After Wren Davis puts my dreams of the NHL in jeopardy, I vow to make her life hell if she ever comes near me again. But she?s my best friend?s foster sister, and even though they don?t live together anymore, their bond is still tight, which makes avoiding each other extra difficult. Especially when I show up at Shadow Valley University and learn my new room comes with an unwelcome addition: Wren Davis. As much as I try to make her life hell, she gives it right back, until she?s not just under my skin but constantly on my mind. But some things can?t be forgiven, and fraternizing with the enemy is the last thing either of us want.</p>

O que Taleb identificou e chama de Antifr?gil n?o s? tira proveito do caos, como precisa dele para sobreviver e florescer. O antifr?gil est? al?m do resiliente e do robusto. Estes resistem a choques e permanecem os mesmos; o antifr?gil, por sua vez, se torna cada vez melhor. Al?m disso, ele ? imune a erros de previs?o e est? protegido de eventos adversos.Extremamente ambicioso e multidisciplinar, Antifr?gil? sobre como se comportar ? e prosperar ? em um mundo cheio de imprevistos.

<p>Summary : Em A l?gica do Cisne Negro, Taleb demonstrou que acontecimentos altamente improv?veis e imprevis?veis dominam a nossa exist?ncia. Em Antifr?gil, o autor confere um novo conceito ? incerteza, tornando-a desej?vel e at? mesmo necess?ria.Assim como ficamos fisicamente mais fortes quando submetidos ? tens?o, muitas coisas se beneficiam do estresse, da desordem e da volatilidade. O que Taleb identificou e chama de Antifr?gil n?o s? tira proveito do caos, como precisa dele para sobreviver e florescer. O antifr?gil est? al?m do resiliente e do robusto. Estes resistem a choques e permanecem os mesmos; o antifr?gil, por sua vez, se torna cada vez melhor.

<p>Summary : Meadows? Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute?s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life.Some of the biggest problems facing the world?war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation?are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into </p>

<p>Summary : An epic account of the decades-long battle to control what has emerged as the world&#8217;s most critical resource?microchip technology?with the United States and China increasingly in conflict.You may be surprised to learn that microchips are the new oil?the scarce resource on which the modern world depends. Today, military, economic, and geopolitical power are built on a foundation of computer chips. Virtually everything? from missiles to microwaves, smartphones to the stock market ? runs on chips. Until recently, America designed and built the fastest chips and maintained its lead as the #1 superpower. Now, America&#8217;s edge is?slipping, undermined by competitors in Taiwan, Korea,?Europe, and, above all, China. Today, as Chip War reveals, China, which spends more money each year importing chips than it spends importing oil,?is pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US. At stake is America&#8217;s military superiority and economic prosperity.Economic historian Chris </p>

<p>Summary : Fernando Pessoa 1935?te ?ld??? zaman, sand???ndaki eserlerinin say?s? tahmin bile edilemezdi. Onun elinden ??km?? ?iirlerin, yaz?lar?n alt?nda genellikle ba?ka imzalar vard?. ?stelik bu isimler yaln?zca birer takma ad de?il, ?yk?s?, ge?mi?i, yazg?s?, d?nya g?r??? farkl? ki?iliklerdi.Pessoa?n?n ?l?m?nden sonra elyazmalar? derlenmeye ba?land??? zaman bitmemi? eserler de bulundu i?lerinde. Bernardo Soares imzal? Huzursuzlu?un Kitab? da bunlardan biriydi. Tarihten, mitolojiden, edebiyattan, ruhbilimden haberdar bir XX. y?zy?l insan?n?n ger?ekli?i yads?y???n?n, kendini hayallere hapsedi?inin g?ncesiydi bu. G?nd?zleri bir ma?azada ?al??an, geceleri yaln?zl???n? ya?murun sesinde, ayak seslerinde duyumsayan bir Lizbonluydu Bernardo Soares ya da Fernando Pessoa.Bug?n sadece Portekiz edebiyat?n?n de?il t?m d?nyan?n en ?nemli eserlerinden biri olarak kabul edilen Huzursuzlu?un Kitab??ndaki her metin, k?r?k bir aynan?n, ger?ekli?in bir yan?n? yans?tan ve sonsuzca ?o?altan bir par?as?&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : From one of the most iconic actors in the history of film, an astonishingly revelatory account of a creative life in full. To the wider world, Al Pacino exploded onto the scene like a supernova. He landed his first leading role, in The Panic in Needle Park, in 1971, and by 1975, he had starred in four movies?The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, Serpico, and Dog Day Afternoon?that were not just successes but landmarks in the history of film. Those performances became legendary and changed his life forever. Not since Marlon Brando and James Dean in the late 1950s had an actor landed in the culture with such force. But Pacino was in his mid-thirties by then, and had already lived several lives. A fixture of avant-garde theater in New York, he had led a bohemian existence, working odd jobs to support his craft. He was raised by a fiercely loving but mentally unwell mother and her parents after his father left them when he was young, but in a real sense he was raised by the streets of </p>

<p>Summary : Controversial evangelical Bible scholar, popular blogger?and podcast host of The Bible for Normal People, and author of The Bible Tells Me So and The Sin of Certainty explains that the Bible is not an instruction manual or rule book but a powerful learning tool that nurtures our spiritual growth by refusing to provide us with easy answers but instead forces us to acquire wisdom. For many Christians, the Bible is a how-to manual filled with literal truths about belief that must be strictly followed. But the Bible is not static, Peter Enns argues. It does not hold easy answers to the perplexing questions and issues that confront us in our daily lives. Rather, the Bible is a dynamic instrument for study that not only offers an abundance of insights but provokes us to find our own answers to spiritual questions, cultivating God?s wisdom within us.?The Bible becomes a confusing mess when we expect it to function as a rulebook for faith.

For many Christians, the Bible is a how-to manual filled with literal truths about belief that must be strictly followed. But the Bible is not static, Peter Enns argues. It does not hold easy answers to the perplexing questions and issues that confront us in our daily lives.

<p>Summary : When a guest dies in the B&amp;B she helps her aunts run, a young witch must rely on some good old-fashioned investigating to clear her aunt&#8217;s name in this magical and charming new cozy mystery.For four hundred years, the Warren witches have used their magic to quietly help the citizens of the sleepy New England town of Evenfall thrive. There&#8217;s never been a problem they couldn&#8217;t handle. But then Constance Graves&#8211;a local known for being argumentative and demanding&#8211;dies while staying at the bed and breakfast Brynn Warren maintains with her aunts. At first, it seems like an accident&#8230;but it soon becomes clear that there&#8217;s something more sinister at work, and Aunt Nora is shaping up to be the prime suspect.There&#8217;s nothing Brynn wants more than to prove Nora&#8217;s innocence, and it hurts her to know that even two years ago that might have been easier. Brynn, after all, is a witch of the dead&#8211;a witch who can commune with ghosts. Ghosts never remember much about their deaths, but Constance </p>

<p>Summary : If only I?d told her that I loved her years ago, then I wouldn?t be here now.Finn has always loved Autumn. She?s not just the girl next door or his mother?s best friend?s daughter, she is his everything. But she?s not his girlfriend. That?s Sylvie, and Finn would never hurt her, so there?s no way Autumn could know how he truly feels.Jack, Finn?s best friend, isn?t so sure. He?s seen Finn and Autumn together. How could she not know? And how is he supposed to support and protect Finn when heartache seems inevitable?Autumn surrounds herself with books and wants to write her own destiny?but one doesn?t always get a new chapter and fate can be cruel to those in love.Told through three different perspectives, If Only I Had Told Her is a love story brimming with truth, tragedy, and unexpected bonds that heal us.</p>

<p>Summary : Born only five years after Pakistan was created in 1947, Imran Khan has lived his country&#8217;s history. Undermined by a ruling elite, and unable to protect its people from the carnage of regular bombings from terrorists and its own ally, America, Pakistan has for years suffered from instability. Now Imran Khan and his own political party, the Tehreek-e-Insaf, offer a real political alternative for the people of Pakistan at a time when tension between Pakistan&#8217;s government and the powerful military has reached dangerous new levels. How did this flashpoint of volatility and injustice come about?Pakistan: A Personal History provides a unique insider&#8217;s view of a country unfamiliar to a western audience. Woven into this history we see how Imran Khan&#8217;s personal life &#8211; his happy childhood in Lahore, his Oxford education, his extraordinary cricketing career, his marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, his mother&#8217;s influence and that of his Islamic faith &#8211; inform both the historical narrativeandhis </p>

<p>Summary : The provocative and hilarious summer read that will have book lovers cheering and everyone talking! Kirsten Miller, author of The Change, brings us a bracing, wildly entertaining satire about a small Southern town, a pitched battle over banned books, and a little lending library that changes everything.Beverly Underwood and her arch enemy, Lula Dean, live in the tiny town of Troy, Georgia, where they were born and raised. Now Beverly is on the school board, and Lula has become a local celebrity by embarking on mission to rid the public libraries of all inappropriate books?none of which she?s actually read. To replace the ?pornographic? books she?s challenged at the local public library, Lula starts her own lending library in front of her home: a cute wooden hutch with glass doors and neat rows of the worthy literature that she?s sure the town?s readers need.But Beverly?s daughter Lindsay sneaks in by night and secretly fills Lula Dean?s little free library with banned books wrapped </p>

<p>Summary : NOTHING WORKS IN BRITAIN.It?s harder than ever to get a GP appointment. Burglaries go unpunished. Wages have been stagnant for years, even as the cost of housing rises inexorably. Why is everything going wrong at the same time?It&#8217;s easy to point the finger at dysfunctional or even corrupt politicians. But in reality it?s more complicated. Politicians can make things better or worse, but all work within our state institutions. And ours are irrevocably broken and outmoded.In Failed State, respected political analyst Sam Freedman offers a devastating analysis of where we?ve gone wrong. Speaking to politicians of all stripes, civil servants, workers on the frontline and key thinkers across the world, this book bursts with insight on the real problems that are so often hidden from the front pages. The result is a witty, landmark book that paves the way for a fairer and more prosperous Britain.</p>

Do you know about Maya Sita or Narada&#8217;s monkey face? Or why Surya falls from the sky or why Chandra commits adultery?The Puranas of Hinduism are a universe of wisdom, embodying a fundamental quest for answers that makes them forever relevant. Now, for the first time, 100 of the greatest mythological tales from these ancient texts have been handpicked and compiled into an epic illustrated edition. Besides popular legends of devas, asuras, sages and kings, Satyarth Nayak has dug up lesser-known stories, like the one where Vishnu is beheaded or where Saraswati curses Lakshmi or where Harishchandra tricks Varuna. Nayak also recounts these 100 tales in a unique chronological format, beginning with Creation in Satya Yuga and ending with the advent of Kali Yuga. Using Puranic markers, he constructs a narrative that travels </p>

<p>Summary : Impossible de parler de g?opolitique sans ?voquer l?id?e de puissance. Rapports de force, zones d?influence, conflits ? politiques, ?conomiques, militaires ? sont la mati?re des relations internationales. La puissance, qu?elle menace ou qu?elle prot?ge, d?termine les conditions d?existence des ?tats et des populations. Le livre s?interroge d?abord sur les crit?res de la puissance?: ses instruments, ses manifestations et jusqu?aux illusions qu?elle engendre. Il dresse ensuite un ?tat des lieux de la plan?te, panorama impeccablement document? et actuel des principales entit?s ?tatiques et des enjeux r?gionaux saillants. Il d?crit enfin de nouveaux acteurs non ?tatiques qui imposent, sur la sc?ne mondiale, des effets de puissance parfois in?dits. S?appuyant au besoin sur des rappels historiques qui sont moins des le?ons que des exemples ?difiants, Fr?d?ric Encel r?ussit ? proposer un tableau coh?rent de l??tat du monde et ? d?gager les grandes tendances de son ?volution.

<p>Summary : In 1950, three years after Jackie Robinson first walked onto the diamond at Ebbets Field, the all-white, upper-crust US Lawn Tennis Association opened its door just a crack to receive a powerhouse player who would integrate &#8220;the game of royalty.&#8221; The player was a street-savvy young Black woman from Harlem named Althea Gibson who was about as out-of-place in that rarefied and intolerant world as any aspiring tennis champion could be. Her tattered jeans and short-cropped hair drew stares from everyone who watched her play, but her astonishing performance on the court soon eclipsed the negative feelings being cast her way as she eventually became one of the greatest American tennis champions. Gibson had a stunning career. Raised in New York and trained by a pair of tennis-playing doctors in the South, Gibson?s immense talent on the court opened the door for her to compete around the world . She won top prizes at Wimbledon and Forest Hills time and time again. The young woman </p>

A pochi metri di distanza, il F?hrer ? asserragliato in un bunker, preda di deliri e paure dopo l?attentato del luglio 1944. Ma Johann Maria Adami non ha tempo di pensare al poco spazio che lo separa dal dittatore, ultimo responsabile del suo internamento a Dachau.

<p>Summary : La neve ? macchiata di sangue, attorno alla torre del castello di Kransberg. A pochi metri di distanza, il F?hrer ? asserragliato in un bunker, preda di deliri e paure dopo l?attentato del luglio 1944. Ma Johann Maria Adami non ha tempo di pensare al poco spazio che lo separa dal dittatore, ultimo responsabile del suo internamento a Dachau. Il professor Adami ha un incarico: scoprire la verit? che si cela dietro la morte sospetta di un soldato nazista. Suicidio? O un complotto alle spalle di Hitler? Veil Seidel, l?ufficiale delle SS che lo ha prelevato d?imperio dal campo di concentramento, ? un suo ex allievo e costringe Johann a una sfida contro il tempo: deve ricorrere a tutto il suo acume per sciogliere l?enigma, non solo nella speranza di salvare se stesso, ma per tenere al sicuro chi pi? ama.La neve ? macchiata di sangue, attorno alle mura della Risiera di Trieste. Non ? la prima volta che succede, e Ada teme, anzi, sa che non sar? l?ultima. Ma individuare l?assassino ? </p>

<p>Summary : From the day Jorge Bergoglio stepped out on the loggia of St. Peter&#8217;s down to the present, Catholics have been confused and dismayed by many of the words and actions of Pope Francis. Not content to allow errors to be spread (whatever their source or putative justification), international groups of pastors and scholars composed documents of inquiry, appeal, critique, and, finally, accusation: the Dubia of the Four Cardinals, the Theological Censures of Amoris Laetitia, the Filial Correction Concerning the Propagation of Heresies, the Open Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church, the Appeal to the Cardinals, and the Protest against Pope Francis&#8217;s Sacrilegious Acts. These historic interventions, which made news around the world at the time of their first appearance and garnered the support of hundreds of thousands of concerned Catholics, are gathered here in a definitive edition for the benefit of all who seek to adhere to &#8220;the faith delivered once for all to the saints&#8221; (Jude 3). </p>

<p>Summary : Gustavo Adolfo B?cquer (1836-1870) es uno de esos contados escritores que han cultivado con id?ntica maestr?a la prosa y el verso. As? lo prueba el presente volumen, en el que se han seleccionado los mejores relatos y poemas del autor sevillano a fin de ofrecer una imagen representativa de su fascinante universo literario. En las Leyendas, B?cquer consigue dotar a sus historias de toda la magia de los cuentos de anta?o y erigir mundo a la vez bello y siniestro que nos recuerda la severa amenaza de lo desconocido y nos provoca m?s de un escalofr?o de terror. El mismo talento evidencian las Rimas, un libro capital de la literatura espa?ola en el que cada poema nos depara un sinf?n de emociones. Sin embargo, B?cquer es mucho m?s que un mero narrador de sucesos inquietantes y un poeta de hondos sentimientos. ya que su obra propone una profunda reflexi?n sobre el gozo y el tormento de la creaci?n art?stica, las luces y las sombras del amor y la irremediable fragilidad del ser humano, </p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;Adrian has a unique gift for understanding drivers and racing cars. He is ultra competitive but never forgets to have fun. An immensely likeable man.&#8217; Damon HillThe world?s foremost designer in Formula One, Adrian Newey OBE is arguably one of Britain?s greatest engineers and this is his fascinating, powerful memoir.How to Build a Car explores the story of Adrian?s unrivalled 35-year career in Formula One through the prism of the cars he has designed, the drivers he has worked alongside and the races in which he?s been involved.A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian?s thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form ? he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in IndyCar racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel </p>

(Trevor Noah) memoir from Bobby Hall, the multiplatinum recording artist known as Logic and the #1 bestselling author of Supermarket.This Bright Future is a raw and unfiltered journey into the life and mind of Bobby Hall, who emerged from the wreckage of a horrifically abusive childhood to become an era-defining artist of our tumultuous age.

In the message boards and livestreams of this brave new world, Bobby became Logic, </p>

He somehow made his way to a job as a writer at Saturday Night Live. While surviving that legendary gauntlet by the skin of his gnashing teeth, he stashed away the secrets of comedy writing?eventually employing them in the immortal ?Motivational Speaker? sketch for Chris Farley, honing them on The Ben Stiller Show, and perfecting them on Mr. Show with Bob and David.In Hollywood, Bob demonstrated a bullheadedness that would shame Sisyphus himself, and when all hope was lost for the umpteenth </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;In her long and extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson has not only succeeded as an actor, she has shaped the course of history.&#8221; -President Barack Obama, 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony&#8221;Just as I Am is my truth. It is me, plain and unvarnished, with the glitter and garland set aside. In these pages, I am indeed Cicely, the actress who has been blessed to grace the stage and screen for six decades. Yet I am also the church girl who once rarely spoke a word. I am the teenager who sought solace in the verses of the old hymn for which this book is named. I am a daughter and a mother, a sister and a friend. I am an observer of human nature and the dreamer of audacious dreams. I am a woman who has hurt as immeasurably as I have loved, a child of God divinely guided by his hand. And here in my ninth decade, I am a woman who, at long last, has something meaningful to say.&#8221; -Cicely Tyson</p>

<p>Summary : Now updated with new research ? the book that has changed millions of lives.After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset ? those who believe that abilities are fixed ? are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset ? those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands </p>

She wanted to see what men were like with no women around.In Aberdeen, Tabitha became deeply entrenched in the world of roughnecks, a teeming subculture rich with brawls, hard labor, and competition. The longer she stayed, the more she found her presence had a destabilizing effect on the men&#8211;and her.Sea State is on the one hand a portrait of an overlooked industry: &#8220;offshore&#8221; is a way of life for generations of primarily working-class men and also a potent metaphor for those parts of life we keep at bay&#8211;class, masculinity, the transactions of desire, and the awful slipperiness of a ladder that could, if we tried hard enough, lead us to security.Sea </p>

<p>Summary : Adam Stern was a student at a state medical school before being selected to train as a psychiatry resident at one of the most prestigious programs in the country. His new and initially intimidating?classmates were high achievers from the Ivy League and other elite universities around the nation. Stern pulls back the curtain on the intense and emotionally challenging lessons he and his fellow doctors learned while studying the human condition, and ultimately, the value of?connection. The narrative focuses on these residents, their growth as doctors, and the life choices they make as they try to survive their grueling four-year residency. Most importantly, as they study how to help distressed patients in search of a better life, they?discover the meaning of failure and the preciousness of success.</p>

<p>Summary : 2 hours, 39 minutes My husband is dead.I attended his funeral. I watched his casket be lowered six feet into the ground. (Actually, it may have been only five feet, but that still seems like more than enough.) And then we ate an array of finger sandwiches and deviled eggs and miniature beef wellingtons that cost more than my first car.My point is, Grant is gone. And so are all his many, many deep, dark secrets which I never really ever bothered to ask him about. He is never coming back. So why do I still see his face everywhere I go?The Widow&#8217;s Husband&#8217;s Secret Lie is an utterly addictive, unputdownable, nail-biting, absolutely gripping psychological thriller novella with a shocking, breathtaking, heartstopping, spine-chilling twist that you won&#8217;t see coming, will leave you stunned, and will literally have you picking your jaw up off the floor and bringing it to the nearest hospital for major facial reconstructive surgery.</p>

<p>Summary : 2 hours, 39 minutes My husband is dead.I attended his funeral. I watched his casket be lowered six feet into the ground. (Actually, it may have been only five feet, but that still seems like more than enough.) And then we ate an array of finger sandwiches and deviled eggs and miniature beef wellingtons that cost more than my first car.My point is, Grant is gone. And so are all his many, many deep, dark secrets which I never really ever bothered to ask him about. He is never coming back. So why do I still see his face everywhere I go?The Widow&#8217;s Husband&#8217;s Secret Lie is an utterly addictive, unputdownable, nail-biting, absolutely gripping psychological thriller novella with a shocking, breathtaking, heartstopping, spine-chilling twist that you won&#8217;t see coming, will leave you stunned, and will literally have you picking your jaw up off the floor and bringing it to the nearest hospital for major facial reconstructive surgery.</p>

<p>Summary : Manchmal verletzen dich die am tiefsten, die du am meisten liebstAls Lily Ryle kennenlernt, scheinen all ihre Tr?ume wahr zu werden: eine neue Stadt, der erste Job und dann noch Ryle ? attraktiv, wohlhabend und bis ?ber beide Ohren in Lily verliebt. Vergessen ist Lilys schwierige Kindheit. Vergessen auch Atlas, ihre erste Liebe. Doch dann trifft Lily zuf?llig Atlas wieder, und auf einmal zeigt Ryle sich von einer Seite, die sie niemals von ihm erwartet h?tte.Eine unter die Haut gehende und teilweise ersch?tternde Geschichte, die einen sofort in ihren Bann zieht.

But it isn&#8217;t the only version of this tale of privilege and deceit.Hernan Diaz&#8217;s &#8216;Trust&#8217; brilliantly puts the story of these </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The brightest star needs the darkest night.&#8221;In a world abandoned by the celestial guardians and left to suffer a tyrant king?s reign, all Astraea knows is safety in seclusion. With fragmented memories of only five years of her life, she?s determined to discover more about her past, even if that means fleeing the cruel arms that hold her safe from the wicked vampires rumored to roam the land.But when Astraea stumbles upon the mysterious Nyte, she soon realizes determination alone isn?t enough to guard her heart. He lingers like the darkness that expands between the stars, and soon she discovers her captor?s wicked means of control weren?t based on a lie to keep her under locks after all. In her desperation, Astraea accepts Nyte?s help before she can decide if she might have sold her allegiance to one of the bloodthirsty beings the people of her world fear.Once their bargain is struck, Astraea?s chance to escape comes in the form of accompanying her best friend Cassia to the King?s </p>

<p>Summary : A deeply moving account ever of walking the Grand Canyon, a highly dangerous, life-changing 750-mile trek.The Grand Canyon is an American treasure, visited by more than 6 million people a year, many of whom are rendered speechless by its vast beauty, mystery, and complexity. Now, in A Walk in the Park , author Kevin Fedarko chronicles his year-long effort to find a 750-mile path along the length of the Grand Canyon, through a vertical wilderness suspended between the caprock along the rims of the abyss and the Colorado River, which flows along its bottom.Consisting of countless cliffs and steep drops, plus immense stretches with almost no access to water, and the fact that not a single trail links its eastern doorway to its western terminus, this jewel of national parks is so challenging that when Fedarko departed fewer people had completed the journey in one single hike than had walked on the moon.

<p>Summary : En cierta ocasi?n, hace ya mucho tiempo, vi un fantasma. S?, un espectro, una aparici?n, un esp?ritu. lo puedes llamar como quieras, el caso es que lo vi. Ocurri? el mismo a?o en que el hombre lleg? a la Luna y, aunque hubo momentos en los que pas? mucho miedo, esta historia no es lo que suele llamarse una novela de terror. Todo comenz? con un enigma: el misterio de un obje?to muy valioso que estuvo perdido durante siete d?cadas. Las L?grimas de Shiva, as? se llamaba ese objeto extraviado. A su alrededor tuvieron lugar venganzas cruzadas, y amores prohibidos, y extra?as desapariciones. Hubo un fantasma, s?, y un viejo secreto oculto en las sombras, pero tambi?n hubo mucho m?s.</p>

<p>Summary : In the vein of Educated and The Glass Castle , Uncultured is more than a memoir about an exceptional upbringing, but about a woman who, no matter the lack of tools given to her, is determined to overcome.Behind the tall, foreboding gates of a commune in Brazil, Daniella Mestyanek Young was raised in the religious cult the Children of God, also known as The Family, as the daughter of high-ranking members. Beholden to The Family?s strict rules, Daniella suffered physical, emotional, and sexual abuse?masked as godly discipline and divine love?and was forbidden from getting a traditional education.At fifteen years old, fed up with The Family and determined to build a better and freer life for herself, Daniella escaped to Texas, bravely enrolled herself in high school, and excelled. She later elected to join the military, where she believed she would finally belong.

<p>Summary : From the bestselling author of I Miss You When I Blink comes a poignant and powerful memoir that tackles the big questions of life, death, and existential fear with humor and hope.A lifelong worrier, Mary Laura Philpott always kept an eye out for danger, a habit that only intensified when she became a parent. But she looked on the bright side, too, believing that as long as she cared enough, she could keep her loved ones safe. Then, in the dark of one quiet, pre-dawn morning, she woke abruptly to a terrible sound?and found her teenage son unconscious on the floor.

<p>Summary : In this comic adventure through the loneliness epidemic, a middle-aged everyman looks around one day and realizes that he seems to have misplaced his friends, inspiring him to set out on a hilarious and ultimately moving quest to revive old tribes and build new ones, in his own ridiculous way.At the age of forty, having settled into his busy career and active family life, Billy Baker discovers that he?s lost something crucial along the way: his friends. Other priorities always seemed to come first, until all his close friendships had lapsed into distant memories. When he takes an assignment to write an article about the modern loneliness epidemic, he realizes just how common it is to be a middle-aged loner: almost fifty million Americans over the age of forty-five, especially men, suffer from chronic loneliness, which the surgeon general has declared one of the nation?s ?greatest pathologies,? worse than smoking, obesity, or heart disease in increasing a person?s risk for premature </p>

<p>Summary : The author of the acclaimed Proust and the Squid follows up with a lively, ambitious, and deeply informative book that considers the future of the reading brain and our capacity for critical thinking, empathy, and reflection as we become increasingly dependent on digital technologies.A decade ago, Maryanne Wolf?s Proust and the Squid revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium.Drawing deeply on this research, this book comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us?her beloved readers?to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don&#8217;t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.&#8221;Dr. Seuss&#8217;s small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His &#8220;wonderful, awful&#8221; idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos&#8217; presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle </p>

Phyllida, Mab, Peter, and Punch have come from England in search of adventure?but they?ll find far more than they bargained for.  After crossing into Italy, the young travelers bid Galassi goodbye. But just as Phyllida is stepping off the train, she realizes she left her raincoat behind. Returning to the cabin, she finds Galassi limp on his seat, his skull fractured. Discovering who attacked the old man will draw these four friends into a deadly plot that could mean the end of their vacation, their friendships?even their lives. </p>
