Mais, en amour, les complications ne sont jamais bien loin.Surtout que Geoffroy, le pr?tendant enamour? de notre adorable peste, ne compte pas s&#8217;effacer si facilement&#8230; Ad?le va devoir faire un choix : courir apr?s le t?n?breux Ludovic qui ne lui accorde pas la moindre attention, ou succomber au gentil Geoffroy qui ferait tout pour elle.? Mr Tan et Diane le Feyer d&#8217;apr?s l&#8217;oeuvre cr??e par Mr Tan et Miss Prickly</p>

<p>Summary :  From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Braiding Sweetgrass, a bold and inspiring vision for how to orient our lives around gratitude, reciprocity, and community, based on the lessons of the natural world. As indigenous scientist and author of Braiding Sweetgrass Robin Wall Kimmerer harvests serviceberries alongside the birds, she considers the ethic of reciprocity that lies at the heart of the gift economy. How, she asks, can we learn from indigenous wisdom and the plant world to reimagine what we value most? Our economy is rooted in scarcity, competition, and the hoarding of resources, and we have surrendered our values to a system that actively harms what we love. Meanwhile, the serviceberry?s relationship with the natural world is an embodiment of reciprocity, interconnectedness, and gratitude. The tree distributes its wealth?its abundance of sweet, juicy berries?to meet the needs of its natural community. And this distribution insures its own survival. As Kimmerer </p>

<p>Summary : ?An epic adventure story set against the most awful war in history. Ridiculously good? Dan Snow&#8217;The black earth was already baking and the sun was just rising when they mounted their horses and rode across the grasslands towards the horizon on fire ??Imprisoned in the Gulags for a crime he did not commit, Benya Golden joins a penal battalion made up of Cossacks and convicts to fight the Nazis.He enrols in the Russian cavalry, and on a hot summer day in July 1942, he and his band of brothers are sent on a desperate mission behind enemy lines.Switching between Benya&#8217;s war in the grasslands of Southern Russia, and Stalin&#8217;s plans in the Kremlin, between Benya&#8217;s intense affair with an Italian nurse and a romance between Stalin&#8217;s daughter and a journalist also on the Eastern Front, this is a sweeping story of passion, bravery and human survival where personal betrayal is a constant companion, and death just a heartbeat away.Praise for Red Sky at Noon&#8217;Red Sky at Noon is an epic adventure </p>

<p>Summary : ?An epic adventure story set against the most awful war in history. Ridiculously good? Dan Snow&#8217;The black earth was already baking and the sun was just rising when they mounted their horses and rode across the grasslands towards the horizon on fire ??Imprisoned in the Gulags for a crime he did not commit, Benya Golden joins a penal battalion made up of Cossacks and convicts to fight the Nazis.He enrols in the Russian cavalry, and on a hot summer day in July 1942, he and his band of brothers are sent on a desperate mission behind enemy lines.Switching between Benya&#8217;s war in the grasslands of Southern Russia, and Stalin&#8217;s plans in the Kremlin, between Benya&#8217;s intense affair with an Italian nurse and a romance between Stalin&#8217;s daughter and a journalist also on the Eastern Front, this is a sweeping story of passion, bravery and human survival where personal betrayal is a constant companion, and death just a heartbeat away.Praise for Red Sky at Noon&#8217;Red Sky at Noon is an epic adventure </p>

<p>Summary : A picture book about the creative process, and the way in which &#8220;mistakes&#8221; can blossom into inspiration.One eye was bigger than the other. That was a mistake.The weird frog-cat-cow thing? It made an excellent bush.And the inky smudges&#8230; they look as if they were always meant to be leaves floating gently across the sky.As one artist incorporates accidental splotches, spots, and misshapen things into her art, she transforms her piece in quirky and unexpected ways, taking readers on a journey through her process.</p>

Second by second and minute by minute, these are the real-life protocols that choreograph the end of civilization as we know it.Decisions that affect hundreds of millions of lives need to be made within six minutes, based on partial information, in the knowledge that once launched, nothing is capable of halting the destruction.Based on dozens of new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, been privy to the response plans, and taken responsibility for crucial decisions, this is the only account of what a nuclear exchange would look like.Nuclear War is </p>

<p>Summary : La Generazione Z ? la prima ad aver attraversato la pubert? con in tasca un portale verso una realt? alternativa eccitante, ma pericolosa. ? la prima ad aver sperimentato la transizione da un?infanzia basata sul gioco a un?infanzia basata sul telefonino, ma anche da un?infanzia libera a una ipercontrollata: mentre gli adulti hanno infatti iniziato a proteggere eccessivamente i bambini nel mondo reale, li hanno lasciati privi di sorveglianza in quello online. Attingendo alle ricerche pi? recenti, Haidt mostra come questa ?riconfigurazione? ha interferito con lo sviluppo di bambini e adolescenti causando ansia, privazione del sonno, frammentazione dell?attenzione, dipendenza, paura del confronto sociale. E mentre ne espone le disastrose conseguenze chiama alle armi genitori, insegnanti, aziende tecnologiche e governi affinch? salvino la salute mentale dei pi? giovani.</p>

Now viewed as a modern classic, this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn&#8217;t arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow!!!!</p>

<p>Summary : From one of the most vital and passionate LGBTQ+ activists comes a powerful memoir about self-discovery, community, love, and resilience in the face of adversity.You never forget your first. First kiss. First love. First heartache.

<p>Summary : Together they will rise. Or together they will fall.The epic finale to the #1 bestselling Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas.Aelin Galathynius has vowed to save her people &#8211; but at a tremendous cost. Locked in an iron coffin by the Queen of the Fae, Aelin must draw upon her fiery will as she endures months of torture. The knowledge that yielding to Maeve will doom those she loves keeps her from breaking, but her resolve unravels with each passing day.With Aelin captured, her friends and allies have scattered. Some bonds will grow even deeper, while others will be severed forever. But as destinies weave together at last, all must stand together if Erilea is to have any hope of salvation.Sarah J. Maas&#8217;s #1 New York Times bestselling Throne of Glass series draws to an explosive conclusion as Aelin fights for her life, her people, and the promise of a better world.</p>

<p>Summary : ? mattina, e Fie non vede l?ora di ricevere il suo messaggio quotidiano. Poche righe che contengono un compito da svolgere per tornare a vivere davvero e rompere la monotonia di giornate sempre uguali. Da qualche settimana, infatti, segue un calendario dell?Avvento in cui a ogni casella corrispondono un consiglio, un obiettivo o una motivazione. Non ? certa di farcela, ma non ha nulla da perdere, e decide di accettare la sfida: solo cos?, in fondo, pu? mettersi in gioco davvero. A inventare questo stratagemma ? stata sua sorella. Sara sa bene che Fie ha bisogno di qualcuno che la sproni a uscire dal guscio in cui si ? rinchiusa dopo essere stata lasciata dal marito e con un figlio che si allontana sempre di pi?. Seguendo le indicazioni contenute nei messaggi, piano piano, Fie vede la sua vita cambiare. Sceglie un nuovo arredamento per la casa; prepara squisiti dolci al tepore del forno; adotta un cane e fa amicizia con i vicini. Piccoli gesti dal valore inestimabile grazie ai quali </p>

<p>Summary : A steamy game of cat and mouse between witch and witch-hunter, played out against a backdrop of opulence, secrets, and bloody history.On the night Rune?s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is.Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe &#8211; a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution &#8211; who she can&#8217;t help but find herself falling for.Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune?s merchant ships to smuggle </p>

<p>Summary : The Lindbergh lens Unique fashion storytelling that first launched the supermodels When German photographer Peter Lindbergh shot five young models in downtown New York City in 1989, he produced not only the iconic British Vogue January 1990 cover but also the birth certificate of the supermodels. The image didn t just bring revered faces together for the first time; it marked the beginning of a new fashion era and a new understanding of female beauty. Coinciding with his major retrospective at the Kunsthal in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, this book gathers more than 400 images from four decades of Lindbergh s photography to celebrate his unique and game-changing storytelling and the new romantic and narrative vision it brought to art and fashion. Whether in striking single portraits or dramatic situations of figure and setting, we trace the photographer s cinematic inflections and his provocative play with female archetypes as subjects adopt the guise of dancers, actresses, heroines, </p>

<p>Summary : Less than three weeks before the 1960 presidential election, thirty-one-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr. was arrested at a sit-in at Rich&#8217;s Department Store in Atlanta. That day would lead to the first night King had ever spent in jail-and the time that King&#8217;s family most feared for his life. While King&#8217;s imprisonment was decried as a moral scandal in some quarters and celebrated in others, for the two presidential candidates-John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon-it was the ultimate October surprise: an emerging and controversial civil rights leader was languishing behind bars, and the two campaigns raced to decide whether, and how, to respond. Based on fresh interviews, newspaper accounts, and extensive archival research, Nine Days is the first full recounting of an event that changed the course of one of the closest elections in American history. Much more than a political thriller, it is also the story of the first time King refused bail and came to terms with the dangerous course of </p>

<p>Summary : Yes, this is a book about God ? who he is, who he?s not, and the staggering implications of who we are as a result. But no, this is not just ?another? book about God.God Has a Name is shaped around one incredibly important paragraph in Exodus. In the well-known story of Moses interacting with God on Mount Sinai, Moses asks to see God?s glory. But what God does ? and says ? is surprising and relevant for anyone who wants to understand God today.??Comer?s fresh voice, creative and contemporary examples, powerful language, and deep respect for the scriptures open up the Bible and the story of God to reveal not only his character but how he interacts with us. And in the end, we will know how to ?carry that name? ourselves and represent God in how we live.For everyone who is trying to understand this God the Bible talks about, the church teaches about, and preachers preach about, this is the place to begin. Ground zero &#8211; where God himself tells us who he really is.</p>

<p>Summary : A tornado has destroyed a small Minnesota community and among the missing are not only a group of students but PEAK Rescue team leader Chet King. Ty Remington will stop at nothing to rescue his mentor, not even when the girl he loved&#8211;and lost&#8211;walks back into his life. But Brette needs his help more than he knows, despite her stubborn determination to push him away. And when he gets a second chance, loving her just might cost him more than he can imagine.A blogger for Vortex Storm Chasers, Brette Arnold didn&#8217;t expect her adventures to land her in the same place as Ty, the guy who she walked&#8211;no, ran&#8211;from over a year ago. She had her reasons&#8211;good ones. The kind that tell her that falling for him again would only lead to heartache.

<p>Summary : A tornado has destroyed a small Minnesota community and among the missing are not only a group of students but PEAK Rescue team leader Chet King. Ty Remington will stop at nothing to rescue his mentor, not even when the girl he loved&#8211;and lost&#8211;walks back into his life. But Brette needs his help more than he knows, despite her stubborn determination to push him away. And when he gets a second chance, loving her just might cost him more than he can imagine.A blogger for Vortex Storm Chasers, Brette Arnold didn&#8217;t expect her adventures to land her in the same place as Ty, the guy who she walked&#8211;no, ran&#8211;from over a year ago.

But Ty isn&#8217;t the kind of man to give up&#8211;not on the missing students, or on her.Life and love hang in the balance in Susan May Warren&#8217;s breathless story of holding on to hope during a deadly summer of storms.</p>

<p>Summary : The average human lifespan is absurdly, insultingly brief. Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks.Nobody needs telling there isn?t enough time. We?re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we?re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and ?life hacks? to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks.Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and </p>

<p>Summary : Benedict Arnold committed treason? for more than two centuries, that?s all that most Americans have known about him.Yet Arnold was much more than a turncoat?his achievements during the early years of the Revolutionary War defined him as the most successful soldier of the era. God Save Benedict Arnold tells the gripping story of Arnold?s rush of audacious feats?his capture of Fort Ticonderoga, his Maine mountain expedition to attack Quebec, the famous artillery brawl at Valcour Island, the turning-point battle at Saratoga?that laid the groundwork for our independence.Arnold was a superb leader, a brilliant tactician, a supremely courageous military officer. He was also imperfect, disloyal, villainous. One of the most paradoxical characters in American history, and one of the most interesting. God Save Benedict Arnold does not exonerate him for his treason?the stain on his character is permanent. But Kelly?s insightful exploration of Arnold?s career as a warrior shines a new light on </p>

<p>Summary : Part field guide, part history, part ornithology primer, and altogether fun. Pigeons are amazing, and until recently, humans adored them. We&#8217;ve kept them as pets, held pigeon beauty contests, raced them, used them to carry messages over battlefields, harvested their poop to fertilize our crops?and cooked them in gourmet dishes. Now, with A Pocket Guide to Pigeon Watching , listeners can rediscover the wonder. Equal parts field guide and quirky history, it covers Why they coo; how they flock; how they preen, kiss, and mate (monogamously); and how they raise their young (on chunky pigeon milk). Anatomy and identification, from Birmingham Roller to the American Giant Runt to the Scandaroon. Birder issues, like what to do if you find a baby pigeon stranded in the park. And our lively shared story together, including all the things we&#8217;ve taught them?Ping-Pong, for example. &#8220;Rats with wings?&#8221; Think again.Pigeons coo, peck and nest all over the world, yet most of us treat them with </p>

<p>Summary : Warum bleiben die Reichen reich und die Armen arm?Weil die Reichen ihren Kindern beibringen, wie sie mit Geld umgehen m?ssen, und die anderen nicht! Die meisten Angestellten verbringen im Laufe ihrer Ausbildung lieber Jahr um Jahr in Schule und Universit?t, wo sie nichts ?ber Geld lernen, statt selbst erfolgreich zu werden.Robert T. Kiyosaki hatte in seiner Jugend einen ?Rich Dad? und einen ?Poor Dad?. Nachdem er die Ratschl?ge des Ersteren beherzigt hatte, konnte er sich mit 47 zur Ruhe setzen. Er hatte gelernt, Geld f?r sicharbeiten zu lassen, statt andersherum. In Rich Dad Poor Dad teilt er sein Wissen und zeigt, wie jeder erfolgreich sein kann.</p>

<p>Summary : From the bestselling and critically acclaimed author of The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace comes a timely, insightful, and groundbreaking look at the school-to-prison pipeline and life in the juvenile &#8220;justice&#8221; system. There has been very little written about juvenile detention and the path to justice.

Here, in Children of the State , Jeff Hobbs challenges any preconceived perceptions about how the juvenile justice system works&#8211;and demonstrates in brilliant, piercing No one so young should ever be considered irredeemable. Writing with great heart and sensitivity, Hobbs presents three different true stories that show the day-to-day life and the challenges faced by those living and working in </p>

<p>Summary : There&#8217;s a serial killer loose in Los Angeles and the local authorities need help fast. For some reason the killer has been leaving a string of maddeningly arcane clues at each crime scene. Each of these clues, it seems, is an indecipherable roadmap to the next murder.Onto the scene comes L, the mysterious super-sleuth. Despite his peculiar working habits, he&#8217;s never shown his face in public?but this time, he needs help.Enlisting the services of an FBI agent named Naomi Misora, L starts snooping around the City of Angels. It soon becomes apparent that the killing spree is a psychotic riddle designed to specifically engage L in a battle of wits. Stuck in the middle between killer and investigator, it&#8217;s up to Misora to navigate both the dead bodies and the egos to solve the Los Angeles Murder Cases.</p>

<p>Summary : The New York Times bestseller from the Grammy-nominated indie rockstar Japanese Breakfast, an unflinching, deeply moving memoir about growing up mixed-race, Korean food, losing her Korean mother, and forging her own identity in the wake of her loss.In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humour and heart, she tells of growing up the only Asian-American kid at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother?s particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother?s tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the east coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, performing gigs with her fledgling band ? and meeting the man who would become her husband ? her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, </p>

<p>Summary : The gilded adventures of Ramses the Damned, iconic creation of the legendary Anne Rice, continue in this breathtakingly suspenseful tale of a titanic supernatural power unleashed on the eve of war. A pharaoh made immortal by a mysterious and powerful elixir, Ramses the Great became counselor and lover to some of Egypt&#8217;s greatest and most powerful rulers before he was awakened from centuries of slumber to the mystifying and dazzling world of Edwardian England. Having vanquished foes both human and supernatural, he&#8217;s found love with the beautiful heiress Julie Stratford, daughter of Lawrence Stratford, the slain archeologist who discovered his tomb. Now, with the outbreak of a world war looming, Ramses and those immortals brought forth from the mists of history by his resurrection will face their greatest test yet. Russian assassins bearing weapons of immense power have assembled under one command: all those who loved Lawrence Stratford must die. From the glowing jewels at their necks </p>
