<p>Summary : Three years. Twelve months. A timeless grief. After losing her beloved sister three years ago, Savannah Litchfield has been living half a life. Now seventeen?the age Poppy died?the pain of losing her is worse than ever. When Savannah&#8217;s therapist suggests a trip around the world to help teens stricken by loss, she reluctantly agrees to it, clutching the unread journal Poppy left her as she goes. Cael Woods is angry. One year after losing his older brother?the person who meant the world to him?his life has spiraled into a heady void of nothing. Once the most promising hockey player in the junior league, Cael can no longer step onto the ice without being paralyzed by memories of his brother. When his parents sign him up for a trip abroad for grieving teens, no part of him wants to go?but he does. As Cael and Savannah embark on a journey of healing, they learn to find solace together, discovering a glimmer of light only the other can bring. And the harder they fall, the more they heal </p>

<p>Summary : Why play is a productive, expressive way of being, a form of understanding, and a fundamental part of our well-being.What do we think about when we think about play? A pastime? Games? Childish activities? The opposite of work? Think again: If we are happy and well rested, we may approach even our daily tasks in a playful way, taking the attitude of play without the activity of play. So what, then, is play? In Play Matters, Miguel Sicart argues that to play is to be in the world; playing is a form of understanding what surrounds us and a way of engaging with others. Play goes beyond games; it is a mode of being human.We play games, but we also play with toys, on playgrounds, with technologies and design. Sicart proposes a theory of play that doesn&#8217;t derive from a particular object or activity but is a portable tool for being?not tied to objects but brought by people to the complex interactions that form their daily lives. It is not separated from reality; it is part of it. It is </p>

<p>Summary : The ?reality slap? is a rude awakening that creates a gap between what you have and what you want. It could be an unwanted divorce, the death of a loved one, or a serious medical diagnosis. It may be as simple as recurring feelings of failure or disappointment that life isn?t going according to plan. The bigger the gap, the harder it is to bridge it?but it is possible. The Reality Slap offers real-life stories and simple exercises to help readers stop depending on things outside of themselves for validation and well-being and instead work on finding peace and fulfillment within. Author Russ Harris was motivated to write this book when his son was diagnosed with autism, prompting a move across the country to be closer to the best school for him. The result is a heartfelt, engaging, and deeply personal guide to discovering what really matters and taking steps toward greater life fulfillment. Readers learn to find peace and calm in the midst of pain and chaos by using painful emotions </p>

<p>Summary : In the wake of China&#8217;s invasion of Tibet throughout the 1950s, Lhamo and her younger sister, Tenkyi, arrive at a refugee camp in Nepal. They survived the dangerous journey across the Himalayas, but their parents did not. As Lhamo-haunted by the loss of her homeland and her mother, a village oracle-tries to rebuild a life amid a shattered community, hope arrives in the form of a young man named Samphel and his uncle, who brings with him the ancient statue of the Nameless Saint-a relic known to vanish and reappear in times of need. Decades later, the sisters are separated, and Tenkyi is living with Lhamo&#8217;s daughter, Dolma, in Toronto. While Tenkyi works as a cleaner and struggles with traumatic memories, Dolma vies for a place as a scholar of Tibetan Studies. But when Dolma comes across the Nameless Saint in a collector&#8217;s vault, she must decide what she is willing to do for her community, even if it means risking her dreams. Breathtaking in its scope and powerful in its intimacy, We </p>

<p>Summary : New York Times BestsellerIn this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be &#8220;positive&#8221; all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we?ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. &#8220;F**k positivity,&#8221; Mark Manson says. &#8220;Let?s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.&#8221; In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn?t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is?a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let?s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected?modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. </p>

<p>Summary : New York Times BestsellerIn this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be &#8220;positive&#8221; all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we?ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. &#8220;F**k positivity,&#8221; Mark Manson says. &#8220;Let?s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.&#8221; In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn?t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is?a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let?s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected?modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. </p>

She invites us to explore the paradoxical union of domesticity and sexual desire, and explains what it takes to bring lust home.In her 20 years of clinical experience, Perel has treated hundreds of couples whose home lives are empty of passion. They describe relationships that are open and loving, yet sexually dull. What is going on?In this explosively original book, Perel explains that our cultural penchant for equality, togetherness, and absolute candor is antithetical to erotic desire for both men and women. Sexual excitement doesn&#8217;t always play by the rules of good citizenship. It is politically incorrect. It thrives on power plays, unfair advantages, and the space between self and other. More exciting, playful, even poetic sex is possible, but first we must kick egalitarian ideals and emotional housekeeping out of our </p>

<p>Summary : A work of unflinching honesty, Autoportrait is a hypnotic memoir of reflection, loss, and everyday joy from one of America?s best contemporary novelistsJesse Ball has produced fourteen acclaimed works of deeply empathetic absurdism in poetry and fiction. Now, he offers readers his first memoir, one that showcases his ?humane curiosity? (James Wood) and invites the reader into a raw and personal account of love, grief, and memory. Inspired by the memoir ?douard Lev? put to paper shortly before his death, Autoportrait is an extraordinarily frank and intimate work from one of America?s most brilliant young authors.The subtle power of Ball?s voice conjures the richness of everyday life. On each page, half-remembered moments are woven together with the joys and triumphs?and the mistakes and humiliations, too?that somehow tell us who we are, why we are here. Held at the same height as tragic accounts of illness or death are moments of startling beauty, banality, or humor: ?I wake in the </p>

<p>Summary : Easton Hayes has been my knight in shining hockey skates since he saved my life. This devastatingly handsome grump may be everyone?s favorite goalie, but to me, he?s my strength when demons haunt my dreams. And okay?so maybe he?s also the only man I?ve ever loved. But he doesn?t need to know that. We?re friends. It works for us. At least, it did. Until I wake up with his ring on my finger and the hangover from hell. But what happens in Vegas doesn?t stay in Vegas when he refuses to give me an annulment and follows me across the country instead. Now our families are furious. Our friends are playing matchmaker. I?m getting goosebumps each time I hear the words ?my wife.? And I think my husband might be in love with me.</p>

<p>Summary : 2022 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence Longlist Selection  A Best Book of 2021 by Chicago Tribune, People, Real Simple, The Washington Post, and Time  The extraordinary story of one woman?s ten-year medical and metaphysical odyssey that brought her physical, creative, emotional, and spiritual healing, by a MacArthur genius and two-time Pulitzer finalist.With a play opening on Broadway, and every reason to smile, Sarah Ruhl has just survived a high-risk pregnancy when she discovers the left side of her face is completely paralyzed. She is assured that 90 percent of Bell?s palsy patients see spontaneous improvement and experience a full recovery. Like Ruhl?s own mother. But Sarah is in the unlucky ten percent. And for a woman, wife, mother, and artist working in theater, the paralysis and the disconnect between the interior and exterior brings significant and specific challenges. So Ruhl begins an intense decade-long search for a cure while simultaneously grappling with the reality </p>

But Jim can?t take all the advice?and has a BIT of a meltdown. Could it be that he just needs a day to feel grumpy?Suzanne and Max Lang bring hilarity and levity to this very important lesson. This picture book is an excellent case study in the dangers of putting on a happy face and demonstrates to kids that they are allowed to feel their feelings (though they should be careful of hurting others in the process!).</p>

<p>Summary : Best-selling author Russell Shorto, praised for his incisive works of narrative history, never thought to write about his own past. He grew up knowing his grandfather and namesake was a small-town mob boss but maintained an unspoken family vow of silence. Then an elderly relative prodded: You?re a writer?what are you gonna do about the story?Smalltime is a mob story straight out of central casting?but with a difference, for the small-town mob, which stretched from Schenectady to Fresno, is a mostly unknown world. The location is the brawny postwar factory town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The setting is City Cigar, a storefront next to City Hall, behind which Russ and his brother-in-law, ?Little Joe,? operate a gambling empire and effectively run the town.Smalltime is a riveting American immigrant story that travels back to Risorgimento Sicily, to the ancient, dusty, hill-town home of Antonino Sciotto, the author?s great-grandfather, who leaves his wife and children in grinding </p>

Ao mesmo tempo um testemunho do amor intenso e ineg?vel entre uma m?e solteira e seu filho, ? tamb?m uma explora??o brutalmente honesta sobre ra?a, classe e masculinidade.Com surpreendente urg?ncia e gra?a, Ocean Vuong escreve sobre pessoas presas entre mundos d?spares e pergunta como podemos curar e resgatar </p>

<p>Summary : In the Hugo-award winning, epic New York Times Bestseller and basis for the BBC miniseries, two men change England&#8217;s history when they bring magic back into the world.In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England &#8211; until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity.Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell&#8217;s pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France.But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing his partnership with Norrell and everything else he holds dear.Susanna Clarke&#8217;s brilliant first novel is an utterly compelling epic tale of nineteenth-century England and the two magicians who, first as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, emerge to change its history.</p>

<p>Summary : Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the son of a little-educated boat-owner in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna. As chief of the country&#8217;s defence research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalam&#8217;s rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent India&#8217;s struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy-a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is about science.</p>

<p>Summary : A fascinating pop-up journey into the hidden world of insects, spiders, and other creepy-crawlies.Larger-than-life bugs spring from the pages, peek out from behind flaps, and hide under tabs, inviting young entomologists to marvel at the mind-boggling variety of arthropod life. What reader can resist a chance to look inside a cockroach?s body to see how it works or open a wasps? nest to see what?s inside? Useful information (why does the world need bees?) and scientific trivia (which beetles are strongest and fastest?) pack every page, while exquisite art and dramatic pop-ups bring the world of bugs to teeming life.</p>

<p>Summary : The fully authorized and official biography of legendary Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, one of the world?s most revered and celebrated musicians of the last half century.Forewords by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.Charlie Watts was one of the most decorated musicians in the world, having joined the Rolling Stones, a few months after their formation, early in 1963.A student of jazz drumming, he was headhunted by the band after bumping into them regularly in London?s rhythm and blues clubs. Once installed at the drum seat, he didn?t miss a gig, album or tour in his 60 years in the band. He was there throughout the swinging sixties, the early shot at superstardom and the Stones&#8217; world conquest; and throughout the debauchery of the 1970s, typified by 1972&#8217;s Exile on Main St., considered one of the great albums of the century. By the 1980s, Charlie was battling his own demons, but emerged unscathed to enhance his unparalleled reputation even further over the ensuing decades.Watts </p>

<p>Summary : The fully authorized and official biography of legendary Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, one of the world?s most revered and celebrated musicians of the last half century.Forewords by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.Charlie Watts was one of the most decorated musicians in the world, having joined the Rolling Stones, a few months after their formation, early in 1963.A student of jazz drumming, he was headhunted by the band after bumping into them regularly in London?s rhythm and blues clubs. Once installed at the drum seat, he didn?t miss a gig, album or tour in his 60 years in the band. He was there throughout the swinging sixties, the early shot at superstardom and the Stones&#8217; world conquest; and throughout the debauchery of the 1970s, typified by 1972&#8217;s Exile on Main St., considered one of the great albums of the century. By the 1980s, Charlie was battling his own demons, but emerged unscathed to enhance his unparalleled reputation even further over the ensuing decades.Watts </p>

Pearson comes a thrilling romantic fantasy full of dangerous fae, dark secrets, and addictive romanceAfter losing both their parents, Bristol Keats and her sisters struggle to stay afloat in their small, quiet town of Bowskeep. When Bristol begins to receive letters from an ?aunt? she?s never heard of who promises she can help, she reluctantly agrees to meet?and discovers that everything she thought she knew about her family is a lie. Even her father might still be alive, not killed but kidnapped by terrifying creatures to a whole other realm?the one he is from.Desperate to save her father and find the truth, Bristol journeys to a land of gods and fae and monsters. Pulled into a dangerous world of magic and intrigue, she makes a deadly bargain with the fae king, Tyghan. But what she doesn&#8217;t know is that he&#8217;s the one who drove her parents to live a life on the run. And he is just as determined as she is to find her father?dead or alive.</p>

<p>Summary : Christophe Pourny learned the art of furniture restoration in his father?s atelier in the South of France. In this, his first book, he teaches readers everything they need to know about the provenance and history of furniture, as well as how to restore, update, and care for their furniture?from antiques to midcentury pieces, family heirlooms or funky flea-market finds. The heart of the book is an overview of Pourny?s favorite techniques?ceruse, vernis anglais,and water gilding, among many others?with full-color step-by-step photographs to ensure that readers can easily replicate each refinishing technique at home. Pourny brings these techniques to life with a chapter devoted to real-world refinishing projects, from a veneered table to an ebonized desk, a gilt frame to a painted northern European hutch.

<p>Summary :  Welcome to the Centennial. Every 100 years, the island of Lightlark appears to host the Centennial, a deadly game that only the rulers of six realms are invited to play. The invitation is a summons?a call to embrace victory and ruin, baubles and blood. The Centennial offers the six rulers one final chance to break the curses that have plagued their realms for centuries. Each ruler has something to hide. Each realm?s curse is uniquely wicked. To destroy the curses, one ruler must die.Isla Crown is the young ruler of Wildling?a realm of temptresses cursed to kill anyone they fall in love with. They are feared and despised, and are counting on Isla to end their suffering by succeeding at the Centennial.To survive, Isla must lie, cheat, and betray?even as love complicates everything.</p>

The invitation is a summons?a call to embrace victory and ruin, baubles and blood. The Centennial offers the six rulers one final chance to break the curses that have plagued their realms for centuries. Each ruler has something to hide. Each realm?s curse is uniquely wicked. To destroy the curses, one ruler must die.Isla Crown is the young ruler of Wildling?a realm of temptresses cursed to kill anyone they fall in love with. They are feared and despised, and are counting on Isla to end their suffering by succeeding at the Centennial.To survive, Isla must lie, cheat, and betray?even as love complicates everything.</p>

<p>Summary : The heartfelt memoir of a trans pageant queen from the Philippines who went back into the closet to model in New York City?until she realized that living her truth was the only way to step into her full power.As a young femme in 1990s Manila, Geena Rocero heard, ? Bakla, bakla! ,? a taunt aimed at her feminine sway, whenever she left the tiny universe of her eskinita . Eventually, she found her place in trans pageants, the Philippines? informal national sport. When her competitors mocked her as a ?horse Barbie? due to her statuesque physique, tumbling hair, long neck, and dark skin, she leaned into the epithet. By seventeen, she was the Philippines? highest-earning trans pageant queen.A year later, Geena moved to the United States where she could change her name and gender marker on her documents. But legal recognition didn?t mean safety. In order to survive, Geena went stealth and hid her trans identity, gaining one type of freedom at the expense of another. For a while, it worked. </p>

<p>Summary : One of the world&#8217;s great science writers and a book that reflects on the vast arc of evolutionary history and what it tells us about life on earth. How much do we really know about our past? For centuries, we have yearned to learn more about our ancestors and piece together the story of how we came to be. But language can only record so much. And fossils can be even harder to decipher. We are left groping in the dark, forced to speculate and reconstruct ways of life based on fragments of information. But what if there was a better way? In The Genetic Book of the Dead , Richard Dawkins explores the untapped potential of DNA to transform and transcend our understanding of evolution. In the future, a zoologist presented with a hitherto unknown animal will be able to read its body and its genes as detailed descriptions of the world its ancestors inhibited. This &#8216;book of the dead&#8217; would uncover the remarkable ways in which animals have overcome obstacles, adapted to their environments </p>

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.All contact is lost with the first human colony on Mars during a long and destructive sandstorm. Satellite imagery of the aftermath shows extensive damage to the facility. The fifty-four colonists who called it home are presumed dead.  Three years later, a new mission sets down on the planet surface to investigate what remains of the derelict site. But, it?s not long before they realise the colony is not as lifeless as everyone thought. Someone is still alive &#8212; hiding out somewhere.  Yet, before they can find the elusive colonist a strange illness starts to affect the crew. Pressure now mounts on Biologist, Dr. Jann Malbec, to locate the source and find a way to fight it. However, as she investigates she begins to suspect a dark and deadly secret lurking within the colony. A secret that threatens not just the crew but the entire population of Earth.  With limited resources and time running out, she must find some answers </p>

<p>Summary : Todos ellos tienen historias de vida donde desafiaron las expectativas, fueron contra corriente y persiguieron sus sue?os, a pesar de una tormenta aparentemente imposible de obst?culos y dificultades. Sus historias son incre?bles, al igual que las del m?sico Ed Sheeran, el dise?ador Yves Saint Laurent y los otros chicos inspiradores que llenan las p?ginas de este extraordinario libro.Son libros como estos los que pueden hacer una gran diferencia en la vida de los padres y de sus hijos. En estos tiempos, cualquier publicaci?n que muestre c?mo podemos triunfar ante la adversidad y los prejuicios merece ser le?da una y otra vez.</p>

<p>Summary : Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man&#8217;s life. Knowing he was dying of ALS &#8211; or motor neurone disease &#8211; Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final &#8216;class&#8217;: lessons in how to live.</p>

<p>Summary : An epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China?s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic.When Rin aced the Keju?the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies?it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn?t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin?s guardians, who believed they?d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard?the most elite military school in Nikan?was even more surprising.But surprises aren?t always good.Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard.

<p>Summary : ***30th Anniversary Edition*** Cover note: Each copy of the anniversary edition of The Blind Watchmaker features a unique biomorph. No two covers are exactly alike.Acclaimed as the most influential work on evolution written in the last hundred years, The Blind Watchmaker offers an inspiring and accessible introduction to one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time. A brilliant and controversial book which demonstrates that evolution by natural selection &#8211; the unconscious, automatic, blind yet essentially non-random process discovered by Darwin &#8211; is the only answer to the biggest question of all: why do we exist?</p>

<p>Summary : ?A seven-year old girl on a seventy-foot yacht, for ten years, over fifty thousand miles of sailing. Wavewalker is the incredible true story of how the adventure of a lifetime became one child?s worst nightmare ? and how her determination to educate herself enabled her to escape.Aged just seven, Suzanne Heywood set sail with her parents and brother on a three-year voyage around the world. What followed turned instead into a decade-long way of life, through storms, shipwrecks, reefs and isolation, with little formal schooling. No one else knew where they were most of the time and no state showed any interest in what was happening to the children. Suzanne fought her parents, longing to return to England and to education and stability. This memoir covers her astonishing upbringing, a survival story of a child deprived of safety, friendships, schooling and occasionally drinking water?</p>

<p>Summary : Twelve-year-old Crow has lived her entire life on a tiny, isolated piece of the starkly beautiful Elizabeth Islands in Massachusetts. Abandoned and set adrift in a small boat when she was just hours old, Crow?s only companions are Osh, the man who rescued and raised her, and Miss Maggie, their fierce and affectionate neighbor across the sandbar. Crow has always been curious about the world around her, but it isn?t until the night a mysterious fire appears across the water that the unspoken question of her own history forms in her heart. Soon, an unstoppable chain of events is triggered, leading Crow down a path of discovery and danger.</p>

He is the very thing she?s spent her whole live pretending to be. Only the extraordinary belong in the kingdom of Ilya?the exceptional, the empowered, the Elites.

<p>Summary : Can you live a lie?It?s a ghost town, this place that haunts me, the one that made me.It?s clear to me that I?ll never outgrow Triple Falls or outlive the time I spent here.I can still feel them all, my boys of summer.Even when I?d sensed the danger, I gave in.I didn?t heed a single warning. I let my sickness, my love, both rule and ruin me. I played my part, eyes wide open, tempting fate until it delivered.There was never going to be an escape.All of us are to blame for what happened. All of us serving our own sentences. We were careless and reckless, thinking our youth made us indestructible, exempt from our sins, and it cost us all.I?m done pretending I didn?t leave the largest part of me between these hills and valleys, between the sea of trees that hold my secrets.It?s the reason I?m back. To make peace with my fate.And if I can?t grieve enough to cure myself in my time here, I?ll remain sick. That will be my curse.But it?s time to confess, to myself more so than any other, that </p>

<p>Summary : From the 2-time Tony Award-winner and the star of TV?s Younger, funny and intimate stories and reflections about how crafting has kept her sane while navigating the highs and lows of family, love, and show business (and how it can help you, too).Whether she?s playing an ?age-defying? book editor on television or dazzling audiences on the Broadway stage, Sutton Foster manages to make it all look easy. How? Crafting. From the moment she picked up a cross stitch needle to escape the bullying chorus girls in her early performing days, she was hooked. Cross stitching led to crocheting, crocheting led to collages, which led to drawing, and so much more. Channeling her emotions into her creations centered Sutton as she navigated the significant moments in her life and gave her tangible reminders of her experiences. Now, in this charming and poignant collection, Sutton shares those moments, including her fraught relationship with her agoraphobic mother; ?a painful divorce splashed on the </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Rivalry never tasted so good. <br />
 O? little town of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?it may be charming, but Julien Boire can?t wait to get out of there. Soon he?ll be leaving to take an advanced wine course that will put him on track to become a master sommelier. Meantime, his OCD demands he keep clear of distractions, especially the hot new hire at his aunt and uncle?s restaurant, Martin?s Place. Which should be easy, because Greg Harlow is as ill-suited to Julien as a bold cabernet is to a delicate salmon entr?e. Charismatic and confident, Greg is a TikTok mixologist who could charm a paper bag?even one as tightly wound as Julien. One thing they do have in common: neither wants a relationship. Greg?s history with dating is? complicated. Yet working together isn?t. First, they?re teaming up to launch a series of happy hour events at Martin?s Place. Then they?re agreeing to a no-strings sex pact that involves new worlds of experimentation. Nothing is off-limits. Except a future. It?s exactly </p>
