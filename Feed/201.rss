<p>Summary : The second novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the best of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path that can only end in fire.Hadrian Marlowe is lost. For half a century, he has searched the farther suns for the lost planet of Vorgossos, hoping to find a way to contact the elusive alien Cielcin. He has not succeeded, and for years has wandered among the barbarian Normans as captain of a band of mercenaries.Determined to make peace and bring an end to nearly four hundred years of war, Hadrian must venture beyond the security of the Sollan Empire and among the Extrasolarians who dwell between the stars. There, he will face not only the aliens he has come to offer peace, but contend with creatures that once were human, with traitors in his midst, and with a meeting that will bring him face to face with no less than the oldest enemy of mankind.If he succeeds, he will usher in a peace unlike any in recorded history. If he fails&#8230;the galaxy </p>

There, he will face not only the aliens he has come to offer peace, but contend with creatures that once were human, with traitors in his midst, and with a meeting that will bring him face to face with no less than the oldest enemy of mankind.If he succeeds, he will usher in a peace unlike any in recorded history. If he fails&#8230;the galaxy </p>

<p>Summary : Lea Ypi grew up in the last Stalinist country in Albania, a place of queuing and scarcity, of political executions and secret police. While family members disappeared to what she was told were ?universities? from which few ?graduated,? she swore loyalty to the Party. In her eyes, people were equal, neighbors helped each other, and children were expected to build a better world.Then the statues of Stalin and Hoxha were toppled. Almost overnight, people could vote and worship freely, and invest in hopes of striking it rich. But factories shut, jobs disappeared, and thousands fled to Italy, only to be sent back. Pyramid schemes bankrupted the country, leading to violence. One generation?s dreams became another?s disillusionment. As her own family?s secrets were revealed, Ypi found herself questioning what ?freedom? really means. With acute insight and wit, Ypi traces the perils of ideology, and what people need to flourish.</p>

<p>Summary : A revelatory account of how King George VI and Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s loving marriage saved the monarchy during World War II, and how they raised their daughter to become Queen Elizabeth II, based on exclusive access to the Royal Archives&#8211;from the bestselling author of Elizabeth the Queen and Prince Charles.Granted special access by Queen Elizabeth II to her parents&#8217; letters and diaries and to the papers of their close friends and family, Sally Bedell Smith brings the love story of this iconic royal couple to vibrant life. This deeply researched and revealing book shows how a loving and devoted marriage helped the King and Queen meet the challenges of World War II, lead a nation, solidify the public&#8217;s faith in the monarchy, and raise their daughters, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.When King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in 1936, shattering the crown&#8217;s reputation, his younger brother, known as Bertie, assumed his father&#8217;s name and became King George VI.

<p>Summary : Actors do love their dramas, and the members of the Causton Amateur Dramatic Society are no exception. However, even the most theatrically minded have to admit that murdering the leading man in full view of the audience is a bit over the top. Luckily, Inspector Barnaby is in that audience, and while he may lack certain skills as a theater critic, he?s just the man to catch a killer. Barnaby is in his element, and so is Caroline Graham, a former actress, who tweaks her collection of community-theater artistes and small-town drama queens with merciless delight. The reader?s only regret will be that, eventually, the curtain must come down on the final page.</p>

<p>Summary : From the best-selling author of King Leopold&#8217;s Ghost and Spain in Our Hearts comes the astonishing but forgotten story of an immigrant sweatshop worker who married an heir to a great American fortune and became one of the most charismatic radical leaders of her time. Rose Pastor arrived in New York City in 1903, a Jewish refugee from Russia who had worked in cigar factories since the age of eleven. Two years later, she captured headlines across the globe when she married James Graham Phelps Stokes, scion of one of the legendary 400 families of New York high society. Together, this unusual couple joined the burgeoning Socialist Party and, over the next dozen years, moved among the liveliest group of activists and dreamers this country has ever seen. Their friends and houseguests included Emma Goldman, Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, John Reed, Margaret Sanger, Jack London, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Rose stirred audiences to tears and led strikes of restaurant waiters and garment workers. </p>

Two years later, she captured headlines across the globe when she married James Graham Phelps Stokes, scion of one of the legendary 400 families of New York high society. Together, this unusual couple joined the burgeoning Socialist Party and, over the next dozen years, moved among the liveliest group of activists and dreamers this country has ever seen. Their friends and houseguests included Emma Goldman, Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, John Reed, Margaret Sanger, Jack London, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Rose stirred audiences to tears and led strikes of restaurant waiters and garment workers. </p>

<p>Summary : Che cos?? un bambino vuole dirci chi siamo e il perch?. Sul volto ciascuno porta una storia diversa da leggere e da raccontare. Come questo libro e i ritratti che ne fanno parte. Ciascun bambino, dalla copertina in poi, porta su di s? tratti, pose, colori, segni, pensieri che lo rendono unico, in mezzo a tanti altri suoi simili. Che cos?? un bambino, tra un ritratto e l?altro, tra un bambino e l?altro, suggerisce di notare differenze. Vederle e nominarle non ? un atto discriminatorio. Serve, invece, a crearsi una grammatica visiva che ? pure una grammatica sentimentale. Se fossimo tutti uguali o ci vedessimo nello stesso modo, la realt? sarebbe piatta e ci sentiremmo terribilmente soli.</p>

<p>Summary : A surprise baby romance from USA Today bestselling author Layla HagenThe first time I met Travis Maxwell, he completely charmed me. We spent a glorious week together, knowing that we&#8217;d go our separate ways in the end.One month later, two blue lines turn my life upside down. I&#8217;m pregnant. And the number Travis gave me is no longer in service. Hurt and shocked, I do the right thing anyway and track him down.We agree to be friends&#8211;nothing more&#8211;and to focus on raising our child.Easier said than done.Travis transformed from a master flirt to a caveman, intent on protecting me, and our unborn baby. He spoils me and tends to all my cravings: including supplying my favorite cupcakes on demand, and watching Netflix with me.As we bicker about which season of Bridgerton is better, he suddenly tells me that he wants me.That he needs me. And I need him too.But I want him to want me for me, not just because of the baby.I fear he&#8217;s mixing up his feelings and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the right recipe </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The animating idea of The 1619 Project is that our national narrative is more accurately told if we begin not on July 4, 1776, but in late August of 1619, when a ship arrived in Jamestown bearing a cargo of twenty to thirty enslaved people from Africa. Their arrival inaugurated a barbaric and unprecedented system of chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. This is sometimes referred to as the country&#8217;s original sin, but it is more than It is the country&#8217;s very origin. The 1619 Project tells this new origin story, placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are as a country. Orchestrated by the editors of The New York Times Magazine, led by MacArthur &#8220;genius&#8221; and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, this collection of essays and historical vignettes includes some of the most outstanding journalists, thinkers, and scholars of American history and </p>

<p>Summary : Quando quatro amigos de uma pequena faculdade de Massachusetts se mudam para Nova York em busca de uma vida melhor, eles se veem falidos, sem rumo e amparados apenas por sua amizade e por suas ambi??es. Willem, lindo e generoso, ? aspirante a ator; JB, nascido no Brooklyn, ? um pintor perspicaz e ?s vezes cruel que busca de todas as formas ingressar no mundo das artes; Malcolm ? um arquiteto frustrado que trabalha numa empresa de renome; e o solit?rio, brilhante e enigm?tico Jude funciona como o centro gravitacional do grupo. Com o tempo, o relacionamento deles se aprofunda e se anuvia, matizado pelo v?cio, pelo sucesso e pelo orgulho. No entanto, seu maior desafio, como cada um passa a perceber, ? o pr?prio Jude, um litigante extremamente talentoso na meia-idade, por?m, ao mesmo tempo, um homem cada vez mais atormentado, a mente e o corpo marcados pelas cicatrizes de uma inf?ncia misteriosa, e assombrado pelo que teme ser um trauma t?o intenso que n?o s? n?o ser? capaz de superar ? </p>

Mas, assim que Effy chega ao local, descobre que algu?m j? vive l?: Preston H?loury, um jovem e rabugento acad?mico de literatura, que est? decidido a provar que o autor favorito dela n?o passa de uma fraude.Os dois </p>

<p>Summary : California?s fire season gets hotter, longer, and more extreme every year ? fire season is now year-round. Of the thousands of firefighters who battle California?s blazes every year, roughly 30 percent of the on-the-ground wildland crews are inmates earning a dollar an hour. Approximately 200 of those firefighters are women serving on all-female crews. In Breathing Fire, Jaime Lowe expands on her revelatory work for The New York Times Magazine. She has spent years getting to know dozens of women who have participated in the fire camp program and spoken to captains, family and friends, correctional officers, and camp commanders. The result is a look at how the fire camps actually operate ? a story that encompasses California?s underlying catastrophes of climate change, economic disparity, and historical injustice, but also draws on deeply personal histories, relationships, desires, frustrations, and the emotional and physical intensity of firefighting.</p>

<p>Summary : The story of the orphan Oliver, who runs away from the workhouse to be taken in by a den of thieves, shocked readers with its depiction of a dark criminal underworld peopled by vivid and memorable characters &#8211; the arch-villain Fagin, the artful Dodger, the menacing Bill Sikes and the prostitute Nancy.

<p>Summary : Demi Crawford was Magnolia Falls royalty.I was the boxer from the wrong side of the tracks.She was the epitome of everything good, while I was broody and rebellious.We couldn?t be more different.Her family was enemy number one which made her guilty by association.I despised her before I even knew her.It was easier that way.But now she?d moved in next door to me, and she was everywhere I turned.I couldn?t avoid her no matter how hard I tried.She was beautiful and honest and sweet.Everything I knew I shouldn?t want.Shouldn?t need.They say there?s a fine line between love and hate?and I don?t know when I crossed over.I was so wrapped up in this girl I couldn?t see straight.She was the right hook I never saw coming. Hating her was supposed to be my end game.Loving her? well, that was just the beginning.But the secrets that lived between us threatened to tear us apart.Lucky for her?I was a born fighter.And she was definitely worth the fight.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Una Doncella? <br />
Elegida desde su nacimiento para dar comienzo a una nueva era, la vida de Poppy nunca le ha pertenecido. La vida de la Doncella es solitaria. Jam?s la tocar?n. Jam?s la mirar?n. Jam?s le hablar?n. Jam?s sentir? placer. Mientras espera al d?a de su Ascensi?n, preferir?a estar con los guardias luchando contra el mal que se llev? a su familia que prepar?ndose para que los dioses la encuentren lo bastante digna. Pero la elecci?n nunca ha sido suya. <br />
  Un deber&#8230; <br />
El futuro del reino entero recae sobre los hombros de Poppy, algo que ni siquiera est? demasiado segura de querer para ella. Porque una Doncella tiene coraz?n. Y alma. Y deseo. Y cuando Hawke, un guardia de ojos dorados que ha jurado asegurar su Ascensi?n, entra en su vida, el destino y el deber se entremezclan con el deseo y la necesidad. ?l incita su ira, hace que se cuestione todo aquello en lo que cree y la tienta con lo prohibido. <br />
  Un reino? <br />
Abandonado por los dioses y temido por los mortales, un reino </p>

<p>Summary : From the bestselling author of Norwegian Wood and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World comes a love story, a quest, an ode to books and to the libraries that house them, and a parable for our peculiar times.We begin with a nameless young couple: a boy and a girl, teenagers in love. One day, she disappears . . . and her absence haunts him for the rest of his life.Thus begins a search for this lost love that takes the man into middle age and on a journey between the real world and an other world?a mysterious, perhaps imaginary, walled town where unicorns roam, where a Gatekeeper determines who can enter and who must remain behind, and where shadows become untethered from their selves. Listening to his own dreams and premonitions, the man leaves his life in Tokyo behind and ventures to a small mountain town, where he becomes the head librarian, only to learn the mysterious circumstances surrounding the gentleman who had the job before him. As the seasons pass and the man </p>

<p>Summary : Redigido no s?culo IV, entre Antiguidade e Idade M?dia, as Confiss?es de Agostinho de Hipona s?o ainda hoje um livro surpreendente. Por um lado, pela densidade po?tica e pela originalidade da escrita, e por inaugurar o g?nero da autobiografia como hist?ria da forma??o de uma personalidade, elas representam um marco ?nico na hist?ria da literatura ocidental. Por outro, Agostinho elabora nelas uma nova maneira de fazer filosofia, estranha ? tradi??o antiga, por ser baseada n?o apenas em conceitos abstratos e dedu??es, mas sobretudo na observa??o fina dos movimentos psicol?gicos, das motiva??es interiores e do significado de pequenos fatos e gestos cotidianos. O resultado ? uma leitura incontorn?vel para todos os que se interessam por filosofia, hist?ria ou religi?o.</p>

Por um lado, pela densidade po?tica e pela originalidade da escrita, e por inaugurar o g?nero da autobiografia como hist?ria da forma??o de uma personalidade, elas representam um marco ?nico na hist?ria da literatura ocidental. Por outro, Agostinho elabora nelas uma nova maneira de fazer filosofia, estranha ? tradi??o antiga, por ser baseada n?o apenas em conceitos abstratos e dedu??es, mas sobretudo na observa??o fina dos movimentos psicol?gicos, das motiva??es interiores e do significado de pequenos fatos e gestos cotidianos. O resultado ? uma leitura incontorn?vel para todos os que se interessam por filosofia, hist?ria ou religi?o.</p>

<p>Summary : HarperCollins is proud to present its incredible range of best-loved, essential classics. No man can live a happy life, or even a supportable life, without the study of wisdomLucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC-AD 65) is one of the most famous Roman philosophers. Instrumental in guiding the Roman Empire under emperor Nero, Seneca influenced him from a young age with his Stoic principles. Later in life, he wrote Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, or Letters from a Stoic, detailing these principles in full.Seneca?s letters read like a diary or a handbook of philosophical meditations. Often beginning with observations on daily life, the letters focus on many traditional themes of Stoic philosophy, such as the contempt of death, the value of friendship, and virtue as the supreme good.Using Gummere?s translation from the early twentieth century, this selection of Seneca?s letters shows his belief in the austere, ethical ideals of Stoicism ? teachings we can still learn from today.</p>

<p>Summary : There are seven billion-plus humans crowding the surface of 21st-century Earth. It is an age of intelligent computers, mass-market psychedelic drugs, politics conducted by assassination, scientists who burn incense to appease volcanoes &#8230; all the hysteria of a dangerously overcrowded world, portrayed in a dazzlingly inventive style. Moving, sensory, impressionistic, as jagged as the times it portrays, this book is a real mind stretcher &#8211; and yet beautifully orchestrated to give a vivid picture of the whole.</p>

<p>Summary : 12 hours, 15 minutes Winnifred &#8220;Win&#8221; McNulty has always been wildly independent. Not one to be coddled for her limb difference, Win has spent most of her life trying to prove that she can do it all on her own. And, with some minor adjustments, she&#8217;s done just fine.That is until she has a one-night stand with the incredibly charming Bo, a perfect stranger. And that one night changes everything.While Bo is surprisingly elated to step up to the plate, Win finds herself unsure of whether she can handle this new challenge on her own or if she?ll need a helping hand.Together, Win and Bo decide to get to know one another as friends and nothing more. But, as they both should know by now, life rarely goes according to plan.</p>

<p>Summary : WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN INNOCENT PRANK GOES HORRIBLY WRONG? Natasha, Riya, Anjali and Katherine were best friends in college?each different from the other yet inseparable?until that night. It was the night that began with a bottle of whisky and a game of Ouija but ended with the death of Sania, their unlikeable hostel mate. The friends had vowed never to discuss that fateful night, a pact that kept their friendship and guilt dormant for the last twenty years.  But now, someone has begun to mess with them, threatening to reveal the truth that only Sania knew. Is it a hacker playing on their guilt, or has Sania?s ghost really returned to avenge her death? As the faceless enemy closes in on them, the friends come together once again to recount what really happened that night. But when the story is retold by each of them, the pieces don?t match. Because none of them is telling the whole truth . . . That Night is a dark, twisted tale of friendship and betrayal that draws you in and confounds </p>

<p>Summary : Magnus Chase, a once-homeless teen, is on a death-defying quest across the Norse realms, literally. As a resident of the Hotel Valhalla, this son of the god Frey is now one of Odin&#8217;s chosen warriors. Magnus and his friends, Hearthstone the elf, Blitzen the dwarf, Samirah the Valkyrie, and other heroic characters must use all their wits and special talents in order to defeat fearsome giants, lethal creatures, and meddlesome gods in order stave off Ragnarok. &#8220;A whirlwind of myth, action, and wry sarcasm, perfect for readers hungry for a new hit of that Percy Jackson-type magic.&#8221;&#8211;Horn Book</p>

<p>Summary : 9 hours, 47 minutes Two string players fight their attraction for each other as they compete for center stage in this spicy and emotional romance.Gwen Jackson and Xander Thorne are both musical prodigies, but each has had very different paths to success. Xander was born into classical music royalty, while Gwen had a natural ear for music that was nurtured by a kind shop owner.  After Gwen performs at his friend?s wedding, she?s mortified when she realizes Xander has no clue who she is?despite having worked together for a year at the Pops Orchestra. But she?s more furious that he arrogantly critiques her performance. When Gwen is offered the role of First Chair of the orchestra, something Xander had secretly coveted for years, their existing hostility goes up a notch. But their respect for each other&#8217;s music is undeniable, and their onstage chemistry off the scale. As they begin to explore their feelings for one another, suddenly they&#8217;re box office dynamite and the fragile romance </p>

<p>Summary : En medio de la misi?n, Yuji cambia de lugar con Sukuna, quien derrota con facilidad a la maldici?n de grado especial. Sin embargo, este se sale de control y ataca a Fushiguro. Sukuna se arranca ?l mismo el coraz?n para que Yuji no pueda regresar, pero aun as? vuelve para salvar a Fushiguro, y muere. Gojo cree que esa misi?n fue un plan de los altos mandos para deshacerse de una vez de Sukuna. De vuelta en la escuela, los de segundo invitan a Fushiguro y Kugisaki a un evento con los del plantel de Kioto, en parte para que se sobrepongan del fallecimiento de Yuji. En otro lado, otras maldiciones de grado especial comienzan a conspirar contra Gojo.</p>
