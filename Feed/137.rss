<p>Summary : No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you&#8217;re not breathing properly.There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat 25,000 times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren&#8217;t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of S?o Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don&#8217;t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.&#8221;Dr. Seuss&#8217;s small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His &#8220;wonderful, awful&#8221; idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos&#8217; presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle </p>

<p>Summary : The long-awaited first work of nonfiction from the author of the #1 New York Times bestselling Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: a deliriously entertaining, wickedly intelligent cinema book as unique and creative as anything by Quentin Tarantino.In addition to being among the most celebrated of contemporary filmmakers, Quentin Tarantino is possibly the most joyously infectious movie lover alive. For years he has touted in interviews his eventual turn to writing books about films. Now, with Cinema Speculation, the time has come, and the results are everything his passionate fans?and all movie lovers?could have hoped for. Organized around key American films from the 1970s, all of which he first saw as a young moviegoer at the time, this book is as intellectually rigorous and insightful as it is rollicking and entertaining. At once film criticism, film theory, a feat of reporting, and wonderful personal history, it is all written in the singular voice recognizable immediately as QT?s and </p>

<p>Summary : Love wasn?t the daily special when a grumpy small-town baker delivers a baby in his bakery. Now, all he can think about is that sweet bundle and her tempting single mother.Having a baby in a bakery gives new meaning to taking the bun out of the oven. I?d been in Curmudgeon Bakery for one of those lemon baby-Bundt cakes I?d been craving since I found out I was pregnant. The draw had nothing to do with the baker himself. Tall, tatted, and edgy, looking more like a biker than a man who makes baked goods. I hardly knew him other than taking a tumble in a rainstorm in front of his shop . . . and then tossing myself at him after he rescued me. We shared a moment but it?s not what you?d think. Months later, he delivered my baby among his cookies and cakes. Talk about a second chance encounter. Then he whips up a plan to pretend to be my baby?s father, and everything heats up from there. My body.My heart.My willingness to accept a perfect stranger?s kindness despite him telling me over and </p>

<p>Summary : An affectionate and engaging history of the American bookstore and its central place in American cultural life, from department stores to indies, from highbrow dealers trading in first editions to sidewalk vendors, and from chains to special-interest community destinationsBookstores have always been unlike any other kind of store, shaping readers and writers, and influencing our tastes, thoughts, and politics. They nurture local communities while creating new ones of their own. Bookshops are powerful spaces, but they are also endangered ones. In The Bookshop, we see those stakes: what has been, and what might be lost.Evan Friss?s history of the bookshop draws on oral histories, archival collections, municipal records, diaries, letters, and interviews with leading booksellers to offer a fascinating look at this institution beloved by so many. The story begins with Benjamin Franklin?s first bookstore in Philadelphia and takes us to a range of booksellers including The Strand, Chicago?s </p>

<p>Summary : An affectionate and engaging history of the American bookstore and its central place in American cultural life, from department stores to indies, from highbrow dealers trading in first editions to sidewalk vendors, and from chains to special-interest community destinationsBookstores have always been unlike any other kind of store, shaping readers and writers, and influencing our tastes, thoughts, and politics. They nurture local communities while creating new ones of their own. Bookshops are powerful spaces, but they are also endangered ones. In The Bookshop, we see those stakes: what has been, and what might be lost.Evan Friss?s history of the bookshop draws on oral histories, archival collections, municipal records, diaries, letters, and interviews with leading booksellers to offer a fascinating look at this institution beloved by so many. The story begins with Benjamin Franklin?s first bookstore in Philadelphia and takes us to a range of booksellers including The Strand, Chicago?s </p>

No one in The Community wants for anything. Everyone is provided for. Each Family Unit is entitled to one female and male child. Each member of The Community has their profession carefully chosen for them by the Committee of Elders, and they never make a mistake. Jonas, a sensitive twelve-year-old boy, had never thought there was anything wrong with his Community, until one day.

<p>Summary : From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an intimate and charming memoir of life in and out of the kitchen.Before Stanley Tucci became a household name with The Devil Wears Prada, The Hunger Games, and the perfect Negroni, he grew up in an Italian American family that spent every night around the table. He shared the magic of those meals with us in The Tucci Cookbook and The Tucci Table, and now he takes us beyond the recipes and into the stories behind them.Taste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with anecdotes about growing up in Westchester, New York, preparing for and filming the foodie films Big Night and Julie &amp; Julia, falling in love over dinner, and teaming up with his wife to create conversation-starting meals for their children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and burnt dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.Written with Stanley&#8217;s signature wry humour and </p>

<p>Summary : The sword, saber, and staff weapons of Taijiquan are implements for improving your health, expressing qi, and issuing intrinsic energy (jin). Even though these three weapons are complete training systems of Taijiquan within themselves, each has a primary focus in its practice: Sword develops the skill of extending intrinsic energy through the arms and hands. The handling of the sword is likened to the skills of a Chinese calligrapher with a writing brush, making use of very refined yin and yang movements. Saber develops the skill of issuing qi from the spine. The handling of the saber is equated to the skills of a Chinese archer pulling a bow, making use of movements for drawing-in and releasing energy. Staff develops the skill of directing intrinsic energy through the waist. The wielding of the staff relates to the skills of a Chinese fisherman poling a boat across the water, moving the entire body as one unit with steady, relaxed, and flowing motions. All practicers of Taijiquan </p>

<p>Summary : Soms vertel die kleinste vissies die grootste stories ??Ek?s jammer, ek?s jammer, ek?s jammer ek?s laat,maar ek het geswem tussen mossels en wier.En daar by ?n wrak met ?n skatkis vol goudhet ek en ?n meermin gespeel vir ?n uur.?Glo j? Tjokkie se storie?Tjokkie is ?n vissie met ?n groot verbeelding; hy is altyd vol stories oor hy laat vir klas opdaag. Maar wat sal gebeur as hy eendag r?gtig in die moeilikheid beland? Sal iemand hom dan nog glo?</p>

He proved the limitations of general relativity, and he set a new agenda for theoretical physics. However, as Patchen Barss documents in The Impossible Man, success came at a price.

<p>Summary : Dark secrets from the past bob to the surface in the third novella in the Widow?s Island series.When a body washes up on the state park beach, Deputy Tessa Black?s experience as a former Seattle detective tells her that the death was not an accident. All evidence points to another murder on the remote island.The victim is a local contractor with a shockingly long list of enemies. The more locals Tessa interviews, the more people she suspects?from the bitter ex-wife and estranged current wife to disgruntled former clients and employees. They all have different reasons to want him dead.As Tessa?s investigation heats up, arson and a vicious assault convince her the killer is desperate to hide his crime?and that she?d better solve the case before he claims another victim.</p>

But as one of the few half-orcs left in the world, she knows she?ll never be free, much less find her own happily ever after.Destiny takes an unexpected turn when the emperor offers her a deal. To earn her freedom, she must journey to the mysterious Isles of Fable and track down wielders of outlawed dragon magic. Eager to seize her chance, Daella agrees.When a brutal storm tosses her ship off course, she washes up on the wrong island?right at the feet of Rivelin, a gruff but handsome elven blacksmith, who seems more likely to stab her than help her.

Eager to seize her chance, Daella agrees.When a brutal storm tosses her ship off course, she washes up on the wrong island?right at the feet of Rivelin, a gruff but handsome elven blacksmith, who seems more likely to stab her than help her.

<p>Summary : Real men fought for our freedoms. It?s time we fought for theirs.Pete Hegseth joined the Army to fight extremists. Then that same Army called him one. The military Pete joined twenty years ago was fiercely focused on lethality, competency, and color blindness. Today our brass are following the rest of our country off the cliff of cultural chaos and weakness.Americans with common sense are fighting this on many fronts, but if we can?t save the meritocracy of our military, we?re definitely going to lose everywhere else.The War on Warriors uncovers the deep roots of our dysfunction?a society that has forgotten the men who take risks, cut through red tape, and get their hands dirty. The only kind of men prepared to face the dan?gers that the Left pretends don?t exist. Unlike issues of education or taxes or crime, this problem doesn?t have a zip code solution. We can?t move away from it. We can?t avoid it. We have only one Pentagon. Either we take it back or surrender it </p>

<p>Summary : The first book in Bernard Cornwell&#8217;s epic Sharpe series, which completely transports the reader to an unforgettable time and place in history.At Talavera in July of 1809, Captain Richard Sharpe, bold, professional, and ruthless, prepares to lead his men against the armies of Napoleon into what will be the bloodiest battle of the war. Sharpe has earned his captaincy, but there are others, such as the foppish Lieutenant Gibbons and his uncle, Colonel Henry Simmerson, who have bought their commissions despite their incompetence.After their cowardly loss of the regiment&#8217;s colors, their resentment toward the upstart Sharpe turns to treachery, and Sharpe must battle his way through sword fights and bloody warfare to redeem the honor of his regiment by capturing the most valued prize in the French Army?a golden Imperial Eagle, the standard touched by the hand of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>Summary : The first book in Bernard Cornwell&#8217;s epic Sharpe series, which completely transports the reader to an unforgettable time and place in history.At Talavera in July of 1809, Captain Richard Sharpe, bold, professional, and ruthless, prepares to lead his men against the armies of Napoleon into what will be the bloodiest battle of the war. Sharpe has earned his captaincy, but there are others, such as the foppish Lieutenant Gibbons and his uncle, Colonel Henry Simmerson, who have bought their commissions despite their incompetence.After their cowardly loss of the regiment&#8217;s colors, their resentment toward the upstart Sharpe turns to treachery, and Sharpe must battle his way through sword fights and bloody warfare to redeem the honor of his regiment by capturing the most valued prize in the French Army?a golden Imperial Eagle, the standard touched by the hand of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>Summary : Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords? In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.</p>

<p>Summary : Bestselling, Scotiabank Giller Award-winning writer Ian Williams brings fresh eyes and new insights to today&#8217;s urgent conversation on race and racism in startling, illuminating essays that grow out of his own experience as a Black man moving through the world. With that one eloquent word, disorientation, Ian Williams captures the impact of racial encounters on racialized people&#8211;the whiplash of race that occurs while minding one&#8217;s own business. Sometimes the consequences are only irritating, but sometimes they are deadly. Spurred by the police killings and street protests of 2020, Williams realized he could offer a perspective distinct from the almost exclusively America-centric books on race topping the bestseller lists, because of one salient fact: he has lived in Trinidad (where he was never the only Black person in the room), in Canada (where he often was), and in the United States (where as a Black man from the Caribbean, he was a different kind of only).Inspired by the essays </p>

Then, when Alexander conquers the land, he is given Bagoas as a gift, and the boy is besotted.

<p>Summary : <br />
  The noted inventor and futurist&#8217;s successor to his landmark book </p>
<p>    The Singularity Is Near</p>
<p>   explores how technology will refashion the human race in the decades to come <br />
Since it was first published in 2005, Ray Kurzweil&#8217;s The Singularity Is Near and its vision of the future have been influential in spawning a worldwide movement with millions of followers, hundreds of books, major films (Her, Lucy, Ex Machina), and thousands of articles. During the succeeding decade many of Kurzweil&#8217;s predictions about technological advancements have been borne out, and their viability has become familiar to the public through such now commonplace concepts as AI, intelligent machines, and bioengineering.In this entirely new book Ray Kurzweil brings a fresh perspective to advances in the singularity&#8211;assessing the progress of many of his predictions and examining the novel advancements that, in the near future, will bring a revolution in knowledge and an expansion of human potential. </p>

<p>Summary : Oggi, un apprezzato accademico come Alessandro Barbero ripropone una traduzione di questi godibilissimi poemetti distaccandosi dal tradizionale approccio filologico. I fabliaux, infatti, sono tutti scritti in versi, in lingua d?oil, e come tali tradotti in francese moderno. L?operazione che qui si ? voluta tentare, con lusinghieri risultati, ? stata quella di riproporre la loro freschezza ed immediatezza ad un pubblico pi? vasto, avvezzo alla lettura in prosa come ? quello contemporaneo. Ne ? risultata una traduzione pi? libera, ma assai pi? fruibile, che rivela storie piccanti, vivaci e sarcastiche, proprie di una mentalit? medievale acuta e dissacratoria, ai pi? ? del tutto sconosciuta e insospettata.</p>

<p>Summary : Our narrator?s days are numbered. Estranged from his family, living alone with only his cat Cabbage for company, he was unprepared for the doctor?s diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can set about tackling his bucket list, the Devil appears with a special offer: in exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, he can have one extra day of life. And so begins a very bizarre week . . .Because how do you decide what makes life worth living? How do you separate out what you can do without from what you hold dear? In dealing with the Devil our narrator will take himself ? and his beloved cat ? to the brink. Genki Kawamura&#8217;s If Cats Disappeared from the World is a story of loss and reconciliation, of one man?s journey to discover what really matters in modern life.This beautiful tale is translated from the Japanese by Eric Selland, who also translated The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide. Fans of The Guest Cat and The Travelling Cat Chronicles will also surely </p>

<p>Summary : Our narrator?s days are numbered. Estranged from his family, living alone with only his cat Cabbage for company, he was unprepared for the doctor?s diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can set about tackling his bucket list, the Devil appears with a special offer: in exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, he can have one extra day of life. And so begins a very bizarre week . . .Because how do you decide what makes life worth living? How do you separate out what you can do without from what you hold dear? In dealing with the Devil our narrator will take himself ? and his beloved cat ? to the brink. Genki Kawamura&#8217;s If Cats Disappeared from the World is a story of loss and reconciliation, of one man?s journey to discover what really matters in modern life.This beautiful tale is translated from the Japanese by Eric Selland, who also translated The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide.

<p>Summary : An Amazon #1 Best-Seller! Named the #1 Soccer Book by Football.com. Named a Top 5 Book of the Year by the NSCAA Soccer Journal! Soccer iQ is the first book for soccer PLAYERS! In a world saturated with books about how to coach soccer, Dan Blank finally gives players a book on how to think it. Standing on two decades of collegiate coaching experience, Blank has catalogued soccer&#8217;s most common mistakes and provides simple, connect-the-dots solutions to help players solve their soccer problems. Soccer IQ is soccer&#8217;s first text book for players; an almanac of smarter soccer decisions intended to flatten out the learning curve. It covers everything from hunting rebounds to the value of the toe-ball; from playing in the rain to the world&#8217;s dumbest foul. Blank tells his story from the familiar and humorous voice of a coach who has endured years of stress at the hands of his players. Written in plain-spoken language, Soccer IQ is an easy read and a quick-fix to the most common yet critically </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  This is an updated cover of this Kindle edition. <br />
In a shadowy antiques shop in Rome, violinist Julia Ansdell happens upon a curious piece of music?the Incendio waltz?and is immediately entranced by its unusual composition. Full of passion, torment, and chilling beauty, and seemingly unknown to the world, the waltz, its mournful minor key, its feverish arpeggios, appear to dance with a strange life of their own.

Her quest beckons Julia to the ancient city of Venice, where </p>

<p>Summary : The Psychology of Money&#8217; Tamil Edition. TIMELESS LESSONS ON WEALTH, GREED, AND HAPPINESS Doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters.</p>

<p>Summary : L&#8217;apocalypse a eu lieu. Le monde est d?vast?, couvert de cendres et de cadavres. Parmi les survivants, un p?re et son fils errent sur une route, poussant un caddie rempli d&#8217;objets h?t?roclites, cens?s les aider dans leur voyage. Sous la pluie, la neige et le froid, ils avancent vers les c?tes du sud, la peur au ventre : des hordes de sauvages cannibales terrorisent ce qui reste de l&#8217;humanit?. Survivront-ils ? leur p?riple ?Apr?s &#8220;Le Rapport de Brodeck&#8221;, Manu Larcenet adapte de nouveau une ?uvre majeure de la litt?rature. Couronn?e par le prix Pulitzer en 2007, &#8220;La Route&#8221; a connu un grand succ?s et a ?t? adapt?e au cin?ma en 2009 avec Vigo Mortensen dans le r?le principal.Avec cet album, Manu Larcenet r?ussit une adaptation d&#8217;une originalit? absolue et pourtant d&#8217;une totale fid?lit?. En posant son trait sous les mots du romancier, en illustrant les silences du r?cit, l&#8217;artiste s&#8217;est appropri? l&#8217;univers sombre et fascinant du roman de Cormac McCarthy.</p>

He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.</p>

<p>Summary : Featuring a new introduction by the author, Angela Davis: An Autobiography is a classic account of a life in struggle.Angela Davis has been a political activist at the cutting edge of the Black Liberation, feminist, queer, and prison abolitionist movements for more than 50 years. First published and edited by Toni Morrison in 1974, An Autobiography is a powerful and commanding account of her early years in struggle. Davis describes her journey from a childhood on Dynamite Hill in Birmingham, Alabama, to one of the most significant political trials of the century: from her political activity in a New York high school to her work with the U.S. Communist Party, the Black Panther Party, and the Soledad Brothers; and from the faculty of the Philosophy Department at UCLA to the FBI&#8217;s list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Told with warmth, brilliance, humor and conviction, Angela Davis?s autobiography is a classic account of a life in struggle with echoes in our own time.</p>

<p>Summary : A simple sting operation takes a violent and unexpected turn for Detective Eve Ronin in a gripping thriller by #1 New York Times bestselling author Lee Goldberg.Los Angeles County Sheriff?s detective Eve Ronin and her soon-to-retire partner, Duncan Pavone, are running a 24-7 sting in a guard-gated enclave of palatial homes in Calabasas. Their luxury McMansion is a honey trap, set to lure in the violent home invaders terrorizing the community. The trap works, leaving three intruders dead, a body count that nearly includes Eve and Duncan.Eve?s bosses are eager to declare the case closed, but there are too many unanswered questions for her to let go. Was the trap actually for her, bloody payback for Eve?s very public takedown of a clique of corrupt deputies? Or is there an even deadlier secret lurking behind those opulent gates? Eve?s refusal to back down and her relentless quest for the truth make her both the hunter?and the prey.</p>
