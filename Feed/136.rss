<p>Summary : Such a quiet and ordinary wife and mother. Who will even notice what she?s done?Lillian Smith leads an unexceptional life, writing obituaries and killing time with her inattentive husband and disconnected son. Then she meets David, a handsome stranger, in a coffee shop. Lured into an affair, she invents a new persona, one without strings, deadlines, or brooding husbands.Lillian has never felt so reckless, unpredictable, or wanted. But as her affair with David intensifies, she withdraws from everything that?s real, even her closest friend. When evidence of her life as a secret lover finds its way onto her son?s social media, she risks ruining much more than her marriage or reputation.As lies beget lies, Lillian?s two worlds spiral dangerously out of control. And betrayals run deeper than she imagines. Because Lillian isn?t the only one leading a double life.</p>

Jillian Lauren had no idea what she was getting into when she wrote her first letter to prolific serial killer Samuel Little. All she knew was her research had led her to believe he was guilty of many more murders than the three for which he had been convicted.

After maintaining his innocence for decades, Little confessed to the murders of ninety-three women, often drawing his victims in haunting detail as he spoke.

<p>Summary : A lo largo de la historia de la humanidad los libros m?guicis han sido una parte fundamental desde tiempos primigenios: Raudskinna, el terror?fico libro de magia negra island?s; El Gran Grimorio, cuya intenci?n es invocar esp?ritus demon?acos, o El Necronomic?n y El libro de la ley de los muertos, unos tratados de antiguos conjuros y rituyales que se ha destacado como los m?s conocidos dentro de la cultura occidental y cuyas invocaciones pretenden despertar las abominaciones de R&#8217;lyeh y consolidar la permanencia de Cthulhu. El Necronomic?n, Kitab Al-Azif (en ?rabe, El rumor de los demonios por la noche), fue escrito en Yemen en el a?o 730 por el nigromante ?rabe Adbul Alhazred, quien lo redact? tras serle revelado por seres sobrenaturales durante su exilio en el desierto. Se dice que Alhazred muri? despedazado y devorado a pleno d?a por una entidad invisible en un mercado de Damasco y despu?s, el libro fue traducido al griego bizantino por un monje an?inimo.

<p>Summary : Dialectic of Enlightenment is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947. &#8220;What we had set out to do,&#8221; the authors write in the Preface, &#8220;was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism.&#8221;Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present.The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes.

<p>Summary : From the number-one New York Times best-selling author of The 48 Laws of Power comes the definitive new audiobook on decoding the behavior of the people around you.Robert Greene is a master guide for millions of listeners, distilling ancient wisdom and philosophy into essential texts for seekers of power, understanding and mastery. Now he turns to the most important subject of all &#8211; understanding people&#8217;s drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves.??We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr., and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people&#8217;s masks, and how to </p>

<p>Summary : Trevor Noah?s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents? indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa?s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man?s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious </p>

<p>Summary : Escrito por uma das maiores vozes da literatura contempor?nea, esse livro ? um relato n?o apenas sobre a morte de um pai amado, mas tamb?m sobre a mem?ria e a esperan?a que permanecem com aqueles que ficam.Escrito ap?s a morte do pai de Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie em junho de 2020, durante a pandemia de covid-19 que mantinha distante a fam?lia Adichie, Notas sobre o luto ? um poderoso relato sobre a imensur?vel dor da perda e as lembran?as e resili?ncia trazidas por ela.Consciente de ser uma entre milh?es de pessoas sofrendo naquele momento, a autora se debru?a n?o s? sobre as dimens?es familiares e culturais do luto, mas tamb?m sobre a solid?o e a raiva inerentes a ele. Com uma linguagem precisa e detalhes devastadores em cada cap?tulo, Chimamanda junta a pr?pria experi?ncia com a morte de seu pai ?s lembran?as da vida de um homem forte e honrado, sobrevivente da Guerra de Biafra, professor de longa carreira, marido leal e pai exemplar.Em poucas p?ginas, Notas sobre o luto ? um livro </p>

<p>Summary : Summer 1914. A world on the brink of catastrophe.In London, twenty-six-year-old Venetia Stanley?aristocratic, clever, bored, reckless?is part of a fast group of upper-crust bohemians and socialites known as ?The Coterie.? She?s also engaged in a clandestine love affair with the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, a man more than twice her age. He writes to her obsessively, sharing the most sensitive matters of state.As Asquith reluctantly leads the country into war with Germany, a young intelligence officer with Scotland Yard is assigned to investigate a leak of top-secret documents. Suddenly, what was a sexual intrigue becomes a matter of national security that could topple the British government?and will alter the course of political history.An unrivaled master of seamlessly weaving fact and fiction, Precipice is another electrifying thriller from the brilliant imagination of Robert Harris.</p>

<p>Summary : HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics. &#8216;How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods.&#8217; Still considered one of the most important and groundbreaking works of science ever written, Darwin&#8217;s eminently readable exploration of the evolutionary process challenged most of the strong beliefs of the Western world. Forced to question the idea of the Creator, mid-nineteenth century readers were faced with Darwin&#8217;s theories on the laws of natural selection and the randomness of evolution, causing massive controversy at the time. However, Darwin&#8217;s theories remain instrumental in providing the backbone to modern biology today.</p>

<p>Summary : A Read With Jenna Today Show Book Club Pick! After Tova Sullivan?s husband died, she began working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium, mopping floors and tidying up. Keeping busy has always helped her cope, which she?s been doing since her eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget Sound over thirty years ago. Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can imagine but wouldn?t dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his human captors?until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova. Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova?s son disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it?s too late.? Shelby Van Pelt?s debut novel is a gentle reminder that sometimes taking a hard look at the past can help uncover a future that once felt impossible.</p>

<p>Summary : Noor Unnahar is a young female voice with power and depth. The Pakistani poet&#8217;s moving, personal work collects and makes sense of the phases of collapsing and rebuilding one&#8217;s self on the treacherous modern path from teenager to adult. Tinged with the heartbreak of a broken home and the complexity of a rich cultural background, yesterday i was the moon stands out from the Insta-poetry crowd as a collection worth keeping.yesterday i was the moon centers around themes of love and emotional loss, the catharsis of creating art, and the struggle to find one&#8217;s voice. Noor&#8217;s poetry ranges from succinct universal truths to flowery prose exploring her heritage, what it means to find a physical and emotional home, and the intimate and painful dance of self-discovery. Her poetry and art has already inspired thousands of fans on Instagram to engage with her words through visual journal entries and posts of their own, and her fan base only continues to grow.</p>

<p>Summary : Theo Byrne is a promising young astrobiologist who has found a way to search for life on other planets dozens of light years away. He is also the widowed father of a most unusual nine-year-old. His son Robin is funny, loving, and filled with plans. He thinks and feels deeply, adores animals, and can spend hours painting elaborate pictures. He is also on the verge of being expelled from third grade, for smashing his friend&#8217;s face with a metal thermos.What can a father do, when the only solution offered to his rare and troubled boy is to put him on psychoactive drugs? What can he say when his boy comes to him wanting an explanation for a world that is clearly in love with its own destruction? The only thing for it is to take the boy to other planets, while all the while fostering his son&#8217;s desperate campaign to help save this one.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  He?ll get what he wants?even if I?m already taken. <br />
Holt Sebastian is royalty in our world.As CEO of the Sebastian News Corp, he?s the man with all the power. The man who decides if I?ll always just be a local television anchor or if I?ll be the rising star of my own show.I make it my mission to be noticed. Make him see my potential. But soon, it&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s the one in charge.His possessiveness is brutal.His eyes own everything they touch. I feel his gaze on me when he&#8217;s in the room. The heat of them as they rake down my body, taking me in, marking me as his. He doesn?t just want me on the screen?he wants me in his bed. And Holt Sebastian gets what he wants.No one will stop him, no one will get in his way.No one can protect me from his desire.Not even the man who promised nothing would come between us and his ambition?my husband. <br />

<p>Summary : Living Out the Word Made Flesh Sixty years ago I found myself distracted, Eugene Peterson writes. A chasm had developed between the way I was preaching from the pulpit and my deepest convictions on what it meant to be a pastor.  And so began Peterson s journey to live and teach a life of congruence congruence between preaching and living, between what we do and the way we do it, between what is written in Scripture and how we live out that truth.  Nothing captures the biblical foundation for this journey better than Peterson s teachings over his twenty-nine years as a pastor. As Kingfishers Catch Fire offers a never-before-published collection of these teachings to anyone longing for a richer, truer spirituality.  Peterson s strikingly beautiful prose and deeply grounded insights usher us into a new understanding of how to live out the good news of the Word made flesh. This is a stunning record of one man s decision to discover not only how to be a pastor but how to be a human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : The six Herdman children are &#8220;absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world&#8221;. They lie and steal and smoke cigars. They even burned down Fred Shoemaker&#8217;s old toolhouse. Now they&#8217;re taking over the Christmas pageant.The Herdmans have never heard the Christmas story before, and they don&#8217;t know anything about shepherds or Wise Men. When Imogene hears about the swaddling clothes, she demands to know why anyone would tie up a baby and put him in a feedbox. Leroy, Claude, and Ollie are planning on a gift that means much more than gold, frankincense, and myrrh &#8211; the ham from their Christmas basket.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, now also a television movie, has been a favorite of children and their parents since 1972. As C.J. Critt&#8217;s spirited narration captures the lively and outrageous spin that the Herdmans put on the Nativity scene, listeners will delight in this unusual and refreshing interpretation of Christmas.</p>

<p>Summary : From the beloved, critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author comes a spectacularly moving and intense novel of secrecy, misunderstanding, and love , the story of Eilis Lacey, the complex and enigmatic heroine of Brooklyn , T?ib?n?s most popular work twenty years later.Eilis Lacey is Irish, married to Tony Fiorello, a plumber and one of four Italian American brothers, all of whom live in neighboring houses on a cul-de-sac in Lindenhurst, Long Island, with their wives and children and Tony?s parents, a huge extended family that lives and works, eats and plays together.

<p>Summary : Hot on the heels of the New York Times bestsellers The Twin and The Lake, another pulse-pounding read from the undisputed queen of YA thrillers! They said goodbye to their friends and family for the weekend. They weren?t counting on forever.Jagged Island: a private amusement park for the very rich?or the very influential. Liam, James, Will, Ava, Harper, and Paisley?social media influencers with millions of followers?have been invited for an exclusive weekend before the park opens. They?ll make posts and videos for their channels and report every second of their VIP treatment.  When the teens arrive, they&#8217;re stunned: the resort is even better than they?d imagined. Their hotel rooms are unreal, the park?s themed rides are incredible, and the island is hauntingly beautiful. They?re given a jam-packed itinerary for the weekend.  But soon they&#8217;ll discover that something&#8217;s missing from their schedule: getting off the island alive.</p>

<p>Summary : Women are not ancillary to the history of technology; they turn up at the very beginning of every important wave. But they&#8217;ve often been hidden in plain sight, their inventions and contributions touching our lives in ways we don&#8217;t even realize.Author Claire L. Evans finally gives these unsung female heroes their due with her social history of the Broad Band, the women who made the internet what it is today. Learn from Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who wove numbers into the first program for a mechanical computer in 1842. Seek inspiration from Grace Hopper, the tenacious mathematician who democratized computing by leading the charge for machine-independent programming languages after World War II.

<p>Summary : Wagina, wulwa, cipka, szparka, pochwa, srom, joni, kuciapka, piczka? jak j? nazywa?? W?a?ciwe pytanie brzmi: czy jeste? z niej dumna?Wagina cz?sto traktowana jest przez kobiety u?ytkowo, myta, depilowana, a nawet operowana, by sprosta? m?skim wyobra?eniom. Bywa nazywana sromem ? jak sromotna kl?ska. Albo ? pochw?. Jak futera? na miecz, czyli dodatek do m?skiej seksualno?ci. Ciekawe, ?e istniej? cz?onkowie zarz?du, a nie ma pochew zarz?du. Je?li kobieta nie podchodzi z akceptacj?, a nawet dum? do swojej waginy, nie osi?gnie pe?nej satysfakcji z seksu (a wraz z ni? osoba, z kt?r? go uprawia). Ani w ?yciu osobistym. Ani w pracy. Bo wulwa, pi?kna, niesamowita, niemaj?ca sobie r?wnych pod wzgl?dem anatomicznym (penis nie jest bynajmniej tak skomplikowany!), to ?r?d?o kobiecej si?y.Ta ksi??ka to rozmowa seksuologa i psychoterapeuty z dziennikark? i psycholo?k? o tym, jak osi?gn?? orgazm; jak podtrzyma? po??danie w zwi?zku; czy kochanka trzeba zdoby?, czy lepiej go zwyczajnie wynaj??.

<p>Summary : Danny Coughlin pl?gas av en mardr?m s? verklig att den snarare liknar ett varsel: en utsvulten hund som biter och drar i ett illa nedgr?vt kvinnolik.

<p>Summary : From the renowned Booker Prize winner and nationally bestselling author of Snow comes a richly atmospheric new mystery about a woman?s sudden disappearance in a small coastal town in Ireland, where nothing is as it seems&#8230;.?He had seen drowned people. A sight not to be forgotten.?1950s, rural Ireland. A loner comes across a mysteriously empty car in a field. Knowing he shouldn?t approach but unable to hold back, he soon finds himself embroiled in a troubling missing person case, as a husband claims his wife may have thrown herself into the sea.Called in from Dublin to investigate is Detective Inspector Strafford, who soon turns to his old ally?the flawed but brilliant pathologist Quirke?a man he is linked to in increasingly complicated ways. But as the case unfolds, events from the past resurface that may have life-altering ramifications for all involved.At once a searing mystery and a profound meditation on the hidden worlds we all inhabit, The Drowned is the next great Strafford </p>

<p>Summary : N?s passamos a maior parte de nossas vidas pensando no passado e fazendo planos para o futuro. Ignoramos ou negamos o presente e adiamos nossas conquistas para algum dia distante, quando conseguiremos tudo o que desejamos e seremos, finalmente, felizes.Mas, se queremos realmente mudar nossas vidas, precisamos come?ar neste momento. Essa ? a mensagem simples, mas transformadora de Eckhart Tolle: viver no Agora ? o melhor caminho para a felicidade e a ilumina??o.Para compreender a jornada em dire??o a O poder do agora, a primeira coisa a fazer ? deixar para tr?s nossa mente anal?tica e nosso falso ego. Desde o primeiro cap?tulo subiremos rapidamente para uma altitude mais elevada, onde se respira um ar mais leve, o ar espiritual. Embora seja uma travessia desafiadora, Eckhart Tolle nos guia com sua linguagem simples e facilita o entendimento de conceitos complexos ao escrever no formato de perguntas e respostas.Combinando conceitos do cristianismo, do budismo, do hindu?smo, do tao?smo </p>

<p>Summary : N?s passamos a maior parte de nossas vidas pensando no passado e fazendo planos para o futuro. Ignoramos ou negamos o presente e adiamos nossas conquistas para algum dia distante, quando conseguiremos tudo o que desejamos e seremos, finalmente, felizes.Mas, se queremos realmente mudar nossas vidas, precisamos come?ar neste momento. Essa ? a mensagem simples, mas transformadora de Eckhart Tolle: viver no Agora ? o melhor caminho para a felicidade e a ilumina??o.Para compreender a jornada em dire??o a O poder do agora, a primeira coisa a fazer ? deixar para tr?s nossa mente anal?tica e nosso falso ego. Desde o primeiro cap?tulo subiremos rapidamente para uma altitude mais elevada, onde se respira um ar mais leve, o ar espiritual. Embora seja uma travessia desafiadora, Eckhart Tolle nos guia com sua linguagem simples e facilita o entendimento de conceitos complexos ao escrever no formato de perguntas e respostas.Combinando conceitos do cristianismo, do budismo, do hindu?smo, do tao?smo </p>

<p>Summary : Between Two Kingdoms meets Wild . In this heart wrenching and inspirational memoir a woman and her mother, who is suffering from dementia, embark on a road trip through national parks, revisiting the memories, and the mountains, that made them who they are.Steph Jagger lost her mother before she lost her.

Steph watches as the woman who loved and raised her slips away before getting the chance to tell her story, and so Steph makes a promise: her mother will walk it and she will write it.Too aware of her mother?s waning memory, Steph proposes that the two take a camping trip out to Montana?which her mother, on the urging of Steph?s father, agrees to embark upon. An adventure full of horseback riding, hiking, and ?tenting? out West quickly turns into one woman?s reflection on childhood, </p>

<p>Summary : The Lodge of the Golden Windhorse has provided the citizens of Compton Dando with splendid fodder for gossip, prompting speculation of arcane rituals and bizarre sexual practices. But with the murder of the commune s leaders, the rumor-mill goes into overdrive. In trying to solve those murders, Chief Inspector Barnaby is less excited than exasperated. The residents of the Windhorse commune may have been seeking the simple life, but they re all concealing complicated pasts or past lives. Caroline Graham is at her most gleeful when skewering the eccentricities of a closed community, and no one survives unscathed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : The Lodge of the Golden Windhorse has provided the citizens of Compton Dando with splendid fodder for gossip, prompting speculation of arcane rituals and bizarre sexual practices. But with the murder of the commune s leaders, the rumor-mill goes into overdrive. In trying to solve those murders, Chief Inspector Barnaby is less excited than exasperated. The residents of the Windhorse commune may have been seeking the simple life, but they re all concealing complicated pasts or past lives. Caroline Graham is at her most gleeful when skewering the eccentricities of a closed community, and no one survives unscathed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : ?ICH M?CHTE EINFACH NUR, DASS DU GL?CKLICH BIST, FAIRYTALE.??OHNE DICH, KANN ICH NICHT GL?CKLICH SEIN, ELI.?Elijah Coldwell hat genug &#8211; genug von der Panik, genug von all dem Leid, genug von seiner Angst. Alles, was er jetzt will, ist, Harrison Grant ein f?r alle Mal das Handwerk legen und ihn f?r seine Taten zu bestrafen. Denn Grant verwandelte Elijahs Leben vor dreizehn Jahren nicht nur in einen Albtraum; er sorgt seither auch daf?r, dass dieser Albtraum nicht endet.

<p>Summary : ?I don?t just want to hear her laugh, I need to earn it. Every time I gain a little ground, I want more. I want to break out of the shade and back into her light. Without even realizing it, I?ve become addicted to it. To her.? Contract killer Lachlan Kane wants a quiet life working in his leather studio and forgetting all about his traumatic past. But when he botches a job for his boss?s biggest client, Lachlan knows he?ll never claw his way out of the underworld. At least, not until songbird Lark Montague offers him a deal: use his skills to hunt down a killer and she?ll find a way to secure his freedom. The catch? He has to marry her first. And they can?t stand each other. Indie singer-songwriter Lark is the sunshine and glitter that burns through every cloud and clings to every crevice that Lachlan Kane tries to hide inside. The surly older brother of her best friend?s soulmate, Lachlan thinks she?s just a privileged princess, but Lark has plenty of secrets hiding in the shadows </p>

<p>Summary : The heroic tale?of a tiny dragon with a heart of gold and a taste for baked treats! A scrumptious picture book for fans of funny fairytales and fantastic beasts.Ember has always been different from the other dragons. His fearsome roar sounds more like a polite sneeze, and when he breathes fire, the villagers just pat his head and say awwww.Ember fears he?ll never collect a respectable hoard of gold until a chance encounter with a baker causes his fortunes to turn (and his stomach to grumble). As the little dragon soon discovers, the gold you make is way better than the gold you steal?and gold that is shared? That?s best of all.Magic shimmers on every page of author-illustrator Devin Elle Kurtz&#8217;s?feel-good story that celebrates baked goods, dragons, and generosity in equal measure. Filled with adorable illustrations, this is a perfect read aloud for bedtime or brunchtime!</p>

<p>Summary : Maybe it was a grandparent, a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood when you were young and impassioned, helped you to see the world as a more profound place, and gave you sound advice to guide your way through it. For Mitch Albom, it was Morrie Schwartz, the colleage professor who taught him nearly twenty years ago.Perhaps, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as the years passed, the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to see that person again, to ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, and receive wisdom for your busy life the way you once did when you were younger?Mitch Albom got that second chance, rediscovering Morrie in the last months of the older man&#8217;s life. Their rekindled relationship turned in one final &#8216;class&#8217;: lessons in how to live. Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together.&#8211;back cover</p>

<p>Summary : Amy Bloom began to notice changes in her husband, Brian: He retired early from a new job he loved; he withdrew from close friendships; he talked mostly about the past. Suddenly, it seemed there was a glass wall between them, and their long walks and talks stopped. Their world was altered forever when an MRI confirmed what they could no longer ignore: Brian had Alzheimer?s disease.Forced to confront the truth of the diagnosis and its impact on the future he had envisioned, Brian was determined to die on his feet, not live on his knees. Supporting each other in their last journey together, Brian and Amy made the unimaginably difficult and painful decision to go to Dignitas, an organization based in Switzerland that empowers a person to end their own life with dignity and peace.In this heartbreaking and surprising memoir, Bloom sheds light on a part of life we so often shy away from discussing?its ending.

<p>Summary : Um cl?ssico da literatura brasileira contempor?nea, Feliz ano velho ganha nova edi??o pela AlfaguaraFeliz ano velho ? o primeiro livro de Marcelo Rubens Paiva. Aos vinte anos, ele sobe em uma pedra e mergulha numa lagoa imitando o Tio Patinhas. A lagoa ? rasa, ele esmigalha uma v?rtebra e perde os movimentos do corpo. Escrito com sentido de urg?ncia, o livro relata as mudan?as irrevers?veis na vida do garoto a partir do acidente. Ele ? transferido de um hospital a outro, enfrenta m?dicos reticentes, luta para conquistar pequenas rea??es do corpo. Aos poucos, se d? conta de sua nova realidade, irrevers?vel. E entende que ? preciso lutar. O texto expressa a irrever?ncia e a determina??o da juventude, mesmo na adversidade, e a compreens?o precoce ?de que o futuro ? uma quantidade infinita de incertezas.</p>

<p>Summary : The celebratory, revealing, inspiring, and entertaining autobiography of the greatest manager in the history of British soccer ? Over the past four years, Alex Ferguson?has been reflecting on and jotting down the highlights of his extraordinary career, and here he reveals his amazing story as it unfolded, from his very early days in the tough shipyard areas of Govan. Sir Alex announced his retirement as manager of Manchester United after 27 years in the role. He has gone out in a blaze of glory, with United winning the Premier League for the 13th time, and he is widely considered to be the greatest manager in the history of British soccer. Over the last quarter of a century there have been seismic changes at Manchester United, with the only constant element the quality of the manager&#8217;s league-winning squad and United&#8217;s run of success, which included winning the Champions League for a second time in 2008. Sir Alex created a purposeful, but welcoming, and much envied culture at the </p>

<p>Summary : MP3 CD Format In this moving and thought-provoking memoir, a historian offers a personal look at the fallibilities of memory and the lingering impact of trauma as she goes back fifty years to tell the story of being a passenger on an airliner hijacked ? in 1970. On September 6, 1970, twelve-year-old Martha Hodes and her thirteen-year-old sister were flying unaccompanied back to New York City from Israel when their plane was hijacked by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and forced to land in the Jordan desert. Too young to understand the sheer gravity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Martha coped by suppressing her fear and anxiety. Nearly a half-century later, her memories of those six days and nights as a hostage are hazy and scattered. Was it the passage of so much time, or that her family couldn&#8217;t endure the full story, or had trauma made her repress such an intense life-and-death experience? A professional historian, Martha wanted to find out. </p>

<p>Summary : When Peter Ash interrupts a crime in progress, he&#8217;s set on a collision course with dangerous enemies and terrifying technology.A man wanted by two governments, Peter Ash has found a simple, low-profile life in Milwaukee, living with his girlfriend June and renovating old buildings with his friend Lewis. Staying out of trouble is the key to preserving this fragile peace . . . but when Peter spots a suspicious armed man walking into a crowded market, he knows he can&#8217;t stand by and do nothing.Peter does interrupt a crime, but it wasn&#8217;t at all what he&#8217;d expected. The young gunman appeared to have one target and one mission&#8211;but when he escapes, and his victim vanishes before police arrive, it seems there is more to the encounter than meets the eye. Peter&#8217;s hunch is proven correct when a powerful associate from his past appears with an interest in the crime, and an irresistible offer: if he and June solve this mystery, Peter&#8217;s record will be scrubbed clean.While Peter and Lewis trace the </p>

<p>Summary : Last time I saw Cade Whitley, I was the curvy, nerdy girl who tutored him in math. He was the popular boy who only saw me as a friend. Now he?s the CEO of the competition. The second we meet again, we start pushing each other?s buttons? then end up flirting. But that has to be a fluke, right? After all, the only things we have in common are a love for the coffee industry and affection for his matchmaking grandmother. At least, that?s what I think. In high school, I had a crush on him. And it was completely unrequited. I don?t want history repeating itself. Then he kisses me in his office, making my head spin.  This is dangerous. He could break my heart again. My boss could find out. But Cade has a way of making me forget about everything? except him.</p>

<p>Summary : Meet Odder, the Queen of Play: Nobody has her moves. She doesn&#8217;t just swim to the bottom, she dive-bombs. She doesn&#8217;t just somersault, she triple-doughnuts. She doesn&#8217;t just ride the waves, she makes them. Odder spends her days off the coast of central California, practicing her underwater acrobatics and spinning the quirky stories for which she&#8217;s known. She&#8217;s a fearless daredevil, curious to a fault. But when Odder comes face-to-face with a hungry great white shark, her life takes a dramatic turn, one that will challenge everything she believes about herself?and about the humans who hope to save her. Inspired by the true story of a Monterey Bay Aquarium program that pairs orphaned otter pups with surrogate mothers.</p>
